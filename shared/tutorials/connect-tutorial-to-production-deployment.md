2. **Update the API key**: Ensure the `OV_MEET_API_KEY` environment variable in the `.env` file matches the API key configured in your production deployment.

    ```

3. **Update the OpenVidu Meet WebComponent script URL**: In the `public/index.html` file, update the `<script>` tag that includes the OpenVidu Meet WebComponent to use the same base URL as above.
