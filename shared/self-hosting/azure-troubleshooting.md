If something goes wrong during the initial Azure stack creation, your stack may reach some failed status for multiple reasons. It could be due to a misconfiguration in the parameters, a lack of permissions, or a problem with Azure services. When this happens, the following steps can help you troubleshoot the issue and identify what went wrong:

1. Check if the instance or instances are running. If they are not, check the Azure deployment events for any error messages.
2. If the instance or instances are running, SSH into the instance and check the logs of the following files:

    - `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`
    - `/var/log/cloud-init.log`

    These logs will give you more information about the Azure stack creation process.
