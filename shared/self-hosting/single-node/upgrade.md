OpenVidu offers an updater that allows you to upgrade your OpenVidu deployment in an easy and automated way. The updater will take care of the whole process, from stopping the services to updating the configuration files.

## Upgrading OpenVidu Single Node

Upgrade OpenVidu Single Node is very simple. These are the steps you need to follow:


1. SSH into your OpenVidu Single Node server.
2. Execute the following command:

    ```
    sh <(curl -fsSL http://get.openvidu.io/update/latest/update.sh)
    ```

    !!! info
        If instead of upgrading to the latest version you want to upgrade to a specific version, you can execute the following command:

        ```bash
        sh <(curl -fsSL http://get.openvidu.io/update/<VERSION>/update.sh)
        ```

        Where `<VERSION>` is the version you want to upgrade to.


3. This will execute an update script which will guide you from the version you have installed to the latest one. The first thing you will see in the output is the following:

    ```
    Stopping OpenVidu service...
    Backing up files...

        - Backing up file '/opt/openvidu/config' to '/opt/openvidu/backups/<DATE>_<VERSION>/config'
        ... More files ...

    --------------------
    ðŸ“¦ Backup directory: /opt/openvidu/backups/<DATE>_<VERSION>/
    --------------------

    --------------------
    ðŸš€ Updating OpenVidu from 3.x.x to 3.y.y
    --------------------

    ? Do you want to update from 3.x.x to 3.y.y? â€º
    â€¢ Yes
      No
    ```

4. Answer `Yes` to the question and your OpenVidu Single Node will be upgraded to asked version. For each version the system will ask you to confirm the upgrade.
5. A `diff` will be shown with the changes made in the configuration files. You can review the changes and decide if you want to apply them or not. If you want to apply the changes, answer `Yes` to the question. If you want to discard the changes and stop the upgrading process, simply answer `No`.
6. Once the upgrade is finished, it will ask you to pull the images of the services. Answer `Yes` if you want to do it.
7. Start OpenVidu with the following command:

```bash
systemctl start openvidu && journalctl -f -u openvidu
```

The `journalctl` command will show you the logs of the OpenVidu services. You can stop the logs by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

## Backups and Rollback

When you finish the upgrade process, you will have a backup of the previous version in the `/opt/openvidu/backups` directory. To backup to a specific date and version, you can execute the following command:

```bash
cp -r /opt/openvidu/backups/<DATE>_<VERSION>/* /opt/openvidu
```

Where `<DATE>` and `<VERSION>` are the date and version of the backup you want to restore. For example:

```
cp -r /opt/openvidu/backups/2025-02-12-09-50-46_3.0.0/* /opt/openvidu
```

In the previous command, you have to replace the date and version with the one you want to restore.

## Recommendations

- On any upgrade problem, a redeployment is always recommended for a clean installation.
- Keep your Docker and Docker Compose versions updated.
- Remove non-used images and containers to free up disk space. For example, after the upgrade, when OpenVidu is running, you can remove the old images with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker image prune -a
    ```

    This command will remove all the images that are not being used by any container.
