### Domain and SSL Certificate Configuration

There are three possible scenarios for this section:

=== "Let's Encrypt Without Domain Name"

    If you don't have a Domain Name and want to quickly test OpenVidu on AWS, you can use this option, simply selecting the **CertificateType** as _letsencrypt_ and keep the rest of parameters empty.

    It will deploy OpenVidu with a Let's Encrypt certificate generated using [sslip.io](https://sslip.io/){:target="_blank"} based on the public IP created for the deployment.

=== "Let's Encrypt With Domain Name (recommended)"

    For a production environment, it is highly recommended to use this option. It allows you to deploy OpenVidu on AWS with a valid Let's Encrypt certificate for your Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

    You need to previously create an Elastic IP and have a Domain Name pointing to that Elastic IP.

    You can specify the **DomainName** with your FQDN and optionally the **PublicElasticIP** with the Elastic IP that the domain points to.

=== "Custom Certificates"

    Opt for this method if you possess **your own certificate for an existing FQDN**. It enables you to deploy OpenVidu on AWS using your certificates.

    You need to have a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) pointing to a previously created Elastic IP.

    Also, you need a **temporary HTTP server** hosting your private and public certificate under a specific URL. These URLs are needed for the instance to be able to download and install your certificates.

    The configured parameters would look like this:

    ![Custom certificates](../../../../assets/images/self-hosting/shared/aws-owncert.png)

    You need to specify at **OwnPublicCertificate** and **OwnPrivateCertificate** the URLs where the public and private certificates are hosted, respectively. The **DomainName** and **PublicElasticIP** are mandatory parameters.

    Certificates need to be in PEM format and the URLs must be accessible from the instance.

=== "Self-Signed Certificate"

    This option is useful for **development and testing purposes**. It allows you to deploy OpenVidu on AWS with an autogenerated self-signed certificate. This way, you can quickly set up a secure connection without the need to obtain a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

    However, this convenience comes with the caveat that users will need to manually accept the certificate in their web browsers. Please be aware that this configuration is solely for developmental and testing purposes and is not suitable for a production environment.

    These are the parameters needed in this section to use self-signed certificates:

    You can optionally specify a **DomainName**. If no domain name is provided, [sslip.io](https://sslip.io/){:target="_blank"} will be used to generate a domain based on the public IP. Just select the **CertificateType** as _self-signed_.
