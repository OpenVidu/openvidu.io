## Starting, stopping, and restarting OpenVidu

For every OpenVidu node, a systemd service is created during the installation process. This service allows you to start, stop, and restart the OpenVidu services easily.

**Start OpenVidu**

```bash
sudo systemctl start openvidu
```

**Stop OpenVidu**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop openvidu
```

**Restart OpenVidu**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart openvidu
```
