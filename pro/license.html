            <p>
                This is a license, not a sales agreement, between you and Tikal Technologies. The term "Software", as used
                throughout this Agreement, includes all Tikal Technologies and third party software provided to you with, or
                incorporated into OpenVidu Pro, with the exception of any open source software contained in OpenVidu Pro. Tikal
                Technologies grants to you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable (in the event of your failure to comply
                with these terms) license to use the Software solely for your internal business purposes, in accordance with the
                terms set forth in this Agreement and subject to any further restrictions in Tikal Technologies documentation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>2. Limitation on Use.</h4>
            <p>
                You may not attempt to, and, if you are a corporation, you are responsible to prevent your employees and
                contractors from attempting to, (a) modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, create derivative
                works based on, sublicense, or distribute the Software; (b) rent or lease any rights in the Software in any form
                to any third party or make the Software available or accessible to third parties in any other manner; (c) transfer
                assign or sublicense right to any other person or entity, or (d) remove any proprietary notice, labels, or marks
                on the Software.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>3. Proprietary Rights.</h4>
            <p>
                All rights, title, interest, and all copyrights to the Software remain with Tikal Technologies. You acknowledge
                that no title to the intellectual property in the Software is transferred to you and you will not acquire any
                rights to the Software except for the specific license as expressly set forth in section

            <h4>4. Term and Termination.</h4>
            <p>
                Except for evaluation and beta licenses or other licenses where the term of the license is limited per the
                evaluation/beta or other agreement or in the ordering documents, the term of the license is for the duration of
                Tikal Technologies' copyright in the Software. Tikal Technologies may terminate this Agreement, and the licenses
                and other rights herein, immediately without notice if you breach or fail to comply with any of the terms and
                conditions of this Agreement. You agree that, upon such termination, you will cease using the Software. The
                provisions of this Agreement, other than the license granted in section 1 ("License Grant"), shall survive
                termination.

                void or unenforceable provision with a new provision that achieves substantially the same practical or economic
                effect and which is valid and enforceable. This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection
                with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and
                construed in accordance with the law of Spain and Madrid. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of Spain
