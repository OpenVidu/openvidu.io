## OpenVidu Meet vs OpenVidu Platform

If your project requires deeper customization, advanced features, or building custom real-time experiences, consider [**OpenVidu Platform**](../../docs/index.md). It provides low-level SDKs to create any type of interactive experience. Compare both solutions here: [OpenVidu Meet vs OpenVidu Platform](../../openvidu-meet-vs-openvidu-platform.md).
