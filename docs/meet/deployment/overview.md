# OpenVidu Meet deployment overview

## OpenVidu Meet editions

OpenVidu Meet is available in two editions:

### OpenVidu <span class="openvidu-tag openvidu-community-tag" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: top">COMMUNITY</span>

It is completely **open-source and free to use**. It includes all the features you need for your video conferencing solution. Everything listed in the [Features](../index.md#features) section is available in OpenVidu Meet COMMUNITY: HD video, HiFi audio, recording, screen sharing, advanced chat, virtual backgrounds, and more.

OpenVidu Meet COMMUNITY is perfect for production deployments with moderate user load. It can be easily deployed on your own servers, and you can customize its branding to match your organizationâ€™s identity. If necessary, upgrading to OpenVidu PRO is seamless and non-disruptive.

### OpenVidu <span class="openvidu-tag openvidu-pro-tag" style="font-size: 0.9em; vertical-align: top">PRO</span>

It is OpenVidu's **commercial edition** and requires a license. It is meant for high demanding environments with significant user load. On top of every functional feature available in OpenVidu COMMUNITY, OpenVidu PRO brings **2x performance**, **advanced observability**, **scalability** and **fault tolerance** features. As well as **priority support** from our team of experts.

OpenVidu PRO follows a simple pricing model based on the size of your deployment (number of CPU cores). Check the [OpenVidu pricing page](https://openvidu.io/pricing) for more details.
