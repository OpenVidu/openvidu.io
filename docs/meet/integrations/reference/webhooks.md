# Webhooks

## Overview

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications when events occur in OpenVidu Meet. Instead of continuously polling the API, webhooks push event data to your specified endpoint when something happens.


You can access to the Webhooks reference documentation at the following link:

[OpenVidu Meet Webhooks Reference](https://docs.openvidu.io/en/stable/meet/reference/rest/)

or directly in the OpenVidu Meet deployment:
