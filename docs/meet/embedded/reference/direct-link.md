# Direct Link

Redirect users to OpenVidu Meet using simple HTML links. This is the simplest way to integrate OpenVidu Meet into your application - perfect when you want users to join meetings in a new browser tab or window with the polished OpenVidu Meet interface.

## Usage

Create a direct link to an OpenVidu Meet room using a simple HTML anchor tag:

```html
<a href="https://your-meet-domain.com/room/MyRoom-abcdef?secret=12345">Join Room</a>
```

When users click the link, they'll be redirected to OpenVidu Meet in their browser, ready to join the room.

!!! info
    You can get room URLs programmatically from your backend using the [REST API](../../../assets/htmls/rest-api.html#/schemas/MeetRoom){:target="\_blank"} properties `moderatorUrl` or `speakerUrl`.

## API Reference

### Attributes

!!! info
	Direct links accept the same **attributes** as the OpenVidu Meet Web Component. See [Web Component Attributes](./webcomponent.md#attributes) for the full list and descriptions.

Customize the meeting by passing attributes as query parameters in the room URL:

```html
<a href="https://your-meet-domain.com/room/MyRoom-abcdef?secret=12345&participant-name=John&leave-redirect-url=https://meeting.end.url/">
    Join Room as John
</a>
```


### Commands

Direct links do not support programmatic commands since the meeting opens in a separate browser tab/window. If you need to control the meeting programmatically, consider using the [Web Component](./webcomponent.md) or [Iframe](./iframe.md) approaches instead.

### Events

Direct links do not emit events to your application since the meeting runs in a separate browser context. If you need to listen to meeting events, consider using the [Web Component](./webcomponent.md) or [Iframe](./iframe.md) approaches instead.
