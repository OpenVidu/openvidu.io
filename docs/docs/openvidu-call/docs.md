## Architecture

The OpenVidu Call architecture is divided into two main components:

* **OpenVidu Call frontend** which is the client-side application built with Angular and OpenVidu Components.
* **OpenVidu Call backend** which is the server-side application built with Node.js and Express and uses the LiveKit Server SDK library to interact with the OpenVidu Server.

    The server-side application built with Node.js and Express that manages the communication between the OpenVidu Server and the OpenVidu Call Frontend.

    It uses the LiveKit Server SDK library to interact with the OpenVidu Server and handle the authentication, videoconference rooms, recordings, broadcasts, and other features.

    The project architecture is divided into the following directories:

    - `controllers`: Contains the controllers that handle the HTTP requests.
    - `services`: Contains the services that interact with the OpenVidu Server.
    - `models`: Contains the models that define the data structures.
    - `helpers`: Contains the helper functions.

    Additionally, the project hosts the following files:
