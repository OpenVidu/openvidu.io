!!! info "Accessing your application client from other devices in your local network"

    One advantage of [running OpenVidu locally](#run-openvidu-locally) is that you can test your application client with other devices in your local network very easily without worrying about SSL certificates.

    Access your application client through [`https://xxx-yyy-zzz-www.openvidu-local.dev:5443`](https://xxx-yyy-zzz-www.openvidu-local.dev:5443){target="_blank"}, where `xxx-yyy-zzz-www` part of the domain is your LAN private IP address with dashes (-) instead of dots (.).
