!!! warning "Configure the URLs"

	For local development, leave `APPLICATION_SERVER_URL` and `LIVEKIT_URL` variables empty. The function `configureUrls()` will automatically configure them with default values. However, for production, you should configure these variables with the correct URLs depending on your deployment.
