## Run OpenVidu Components Demo App

#### 1. Run OpenVidu Server

=== "Run OpenVidu locally"

    --8<-- "shared/tutorials/run-openvidu-locally.md"

=== "Deploy OpenVidu"

    To use a production-ready OpenVidu deployment, visit the official [deployment guide](../self-hosting/deployment-types.md).

    !!! info "Configure Webhooks"

        OpenVidu Components Demo App have an endpoint to receive webhooks from OpenVidu. For this reason, when using a production deployment you need to configure webhooks to point to your local application server in order to make it work. Check the [Send Webhooks to a Local Application Server](../self-hosting/how-to-guides/enable-webhooks.md#send-webhooks-to-a-local-application-server){:target="\_blank"} section for more information.


#### 2. Download the demo code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-tutorials.git -b 3.4.0
```

#### 3. Run the Components Demo App backend


1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd openvidu-tutorials/openvidu-components-angular/openvidu-demo-app/backend

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the application:

    ```bash
    npm run dev:start
    ```

#### 4. Run the Components Demo App frontend

Launching another terminal, under the `openvidu-tutorials/openvidu-components-angular/openvidu-demo-app` directory:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd openvidu-tutorials/openvidu-components-angular/openvidu-demo-app/frontend

## Architecture

The OpenVidu Components Demo App architecture is divided into two main components:

* **frontend**: which is the client-side application built with Angular and OpenVidu Components.
* **backend**: which is the server-side application built with Node.js and Express and uses the LiveKit Server SDK library to interact with the OpenVidu Server.

=== ":simple-angular:{.icon .lg-icon .tab-icon} Demo App frontend"

    The client-side application built with Angular that provides the user interface for the videoconference. It uses the OpenVidu Components library to create the videoconference layout with ease.

    The project architecture is divided into the following directories:

    - `guards`: Contains the guards that handle the authentication.
    - `models`: Contains the models that define the data structures.
    - `pages`: Contains the components that define the different pages of the application.
    - `services`: Contains the services that interact with the backend in a RESTful manner.

    Additionally, the project hosts the following files:

    - `app.component.ts`: The main file that initializes the Angular application.
    - `app-routes.ts`: Contains the routes that define the application navigation.
    - `app,config.ts`: Contains the configuration settings for the application. This file is where import for the OpenVidu Angular Components are defined.

=== ":simple-nodedotjs:{.icon .lg-icon .tab-icon} Demo App backend"

    The server-side application built with Node.js and Express that manages the communication between the OpenVidu Server and the frontend.

    It uses the LiveKit Server SDK library to interact with the OpenVidu Server and handle the authentication, videoconference rooms, recordings, broadcasts, and other features.

    The project architecture is divided into the following directories:

    - `controllers`: Contains the controllers that handle the HTTP requests.
    - `services`: Contains the services that interact with the OpenVidu Server.
    - `models`: Contains the models that define the data structures.
    - `helpers`: Contains the helper functions.

    Additionally, the project hosts the following files:

    - `server.ts`: The main file that initializes the Express application.
    - `routes.ts`: Contains the routes that define the API endpoints.
    - `config.ts`: Contains the configuration settings for the application.
