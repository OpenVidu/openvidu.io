# Upgrade OpenVidu Single Node <span class="openvidu-tag openvidu-community-tag" style="font-size: .6em; vertical-align: text-bottom">COMMUNITY</span> - Digital Ocean

In Digital Ocean, we recommend upgrading by redeploying [OpenVidu Single Node Digital Ocean](../digitalocean/install.md) with the latest version.

However, if you prefer to upgrade the OpenVidu Single Node without redeploying, you can follow the steps outlined in the [Upgrade OpenVidu Single Node - On Premises](../on-premises/upgrade.md) section.
