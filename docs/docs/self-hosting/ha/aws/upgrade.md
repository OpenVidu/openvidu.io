# Upgrade OpenVidu High Availability - AWS

In version `3.0.0`, OpenVidu High Availability in AWS can't be upgraded using the updater script. We recommend redeploying the [OpenVidu High Availability CloudFormation](../aws/install.md) with the latest version.

From version `3.1.0`, an upgrade mechanism is available.
