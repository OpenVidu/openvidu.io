# Upgrade OpenVidu Single Node <span class="openvidu-tag openvidu-pro-tag" style="font-size: .6em; vertical-align: text-bottom">PRO</span> - Azure

In Azure, we recommend upgrading by redeploying [OpenVidu Single Node Azure](../azure/install.md) with the latest version.

However, if you prefer to upgrade the OpenVidu Single Node without redeploying, you can follow the steps outlined in the [Upgrade OpenVidu Single Node - On Premises](../on-premises/upgrade-pro.md) section.
