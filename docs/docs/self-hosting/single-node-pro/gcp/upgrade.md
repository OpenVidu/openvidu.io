In Google Cloud Platform, we recommend upgrading by redeploying [OpenVidu Single Node Google Cloud Platform](../azure/install.md) with the latest version.

However, if you prefer to upgrade the OpenVidu Single Node without redeploying, you can follow the steps outlined in the [Upgrade OpenVidu Single Node - On Premises](../on-premises/upgrade.md) section.
