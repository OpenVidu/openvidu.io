# <span class="openvidu-tag openvidu-pro-tag" style="font-size: .5em">PRO</span> Upgrade OpenVidu Elastic - AWS

In version `3.0.0`, OpenVidu Elastic in AWS can't be upgraded using the updater script. We recommend redeploying the [OpenVidu Elastic CloudFormation](../aws/install.md) with the latest version.

From version `3.1.0`, an upgrade mechanism is available.
