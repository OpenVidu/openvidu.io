# OpenVidu Elastic installation: Azure

!!! warning

    Azure deployments are considered in Beta in version 3.3.0 of OpenVidu.

!!! info
    
    OpenVidu Elastic is part of **OpenVidu <span class="openvidu-tag openvidu-pro-tag" style="font-size: 12px; vertical-align: top;">PRO</span>**. Before deploying, you need to [create an OpenVidu account](/account/){:target=_blank} to get your license key.
    There's a 15-day free trial waiting for you!

This section contains the instructions to deploy a production-ready OpenVidu Elastic deployment in Azure. Deployed services are the same as the [On Premises Elastic installation](../on-premises/install.md) but they will be resources in Azure and you can automate the process with the Template Spec of ARM.

To import the template into Azure you just need to click the button below and you will be redirected to azure.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FOpenVidu%2Fopenvidu%2Frefs%2Ftags%2Fv3.3.0%2Fopenvidu-deployment%2Fpro%2Felastic%2Fazure%2Fcf-openvidu-elastic.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FOpenVidu%2Fopenvidu%2Frefs%2Ftags%2Fv3.3.0%2Fopenvidu-deployment%2Fpro%2Felastic%2Fazure%2FcreateUiDefinition.json){:target=_blank}
</div>

=== "Architecture overview"

    This is how the architecture of the deployment looks like:

    <figure markdown>

    </figure>

    - The Master Node acts as a Load Balancer, managing the traffic and distributing it among the Media Nodes and deployed services in the Master Node.
    - The Master Node has its own Caddy server acting as a Layer 4 (for TURN with TLS and RTMPS) and Layer 7 (for OpenVidu Dashboard, OpenVidu Call, etc., APIs) reverse proxy.
    - WebRTC traffic (SRTP/SCTP/STUN/TURN) is routed directly to the Media Nodes.
    - A Scaling Set of Media Nodes is created to scale the number of Media Nodes based on the system load.

--8<-- "shared/self-hosting/azure-resource-group-stack-name.md"

--8<-- "shared/self-hosting/azure-ssl-domain.md"

### OpenVidu Elastic Configuration

In this section, you need to specify some properties needed for the OpenVidu Elastic deployment.

=== "OpenVidu Elastic Configuration"

    Parameters of this section look like this:

    <figure markdown>
    ![OpenVidu Elastic Configuration](../../../../assets/images/self-hosting/elastic/azure/openvidu-elastic-config.png){ .svg-img .dark-img }
    </figure>

    Make sure to provide the **OpenVidu License** parameter with the license key. If you don't have one, you can request one [here](/account/){:target=_blank}.

    For the **RTC Engine** parameter, you can choose between **Pion** (the default engine used by LiveKit) and **Mediasoup** (with a boost in performance). Learn more about the differences [here](../../production-ready/performance.md).

### Azure Instance Configuration

You need to specify some properties for the Azure instances that will be created.

=== "Azure Instance configuration"

    Parameters in this section look like this:

    <figure markdown>
    ![Azure Instance configuration](../../../../assets/images/self-hosting/elastic/azure/azure-instance-config.png){ .svg-img .dark-img }
    </figure>

    Simply select the type of instance you want for your Master Node at **Master Node Instance Type** and select the type of instance you want for your Media Nodes at **Media Node Instance Type**. Fill in the parameter **Admin Username** that will be set as admin username in the instance. Select the SSH key you've created previously in **SSH public key source** (or create a new one in the same drop down) to allow you to SSH into the instances.
 
### Media Nodes Scaling Set Configuration

The number of Media Nodes can scale up based on the system load. You can configure the minimum and maximum number of Media Nodes and a target CPU utilization to trigger the scaling up.

=== "Media Nodes Scaling Set Configuration"

    Parameters in this section look like this:

    <figure markdown>
    ![Media Nodes Scaling Set Configuration](../../../../assets/images/self-hosting/elastic/azure/media-nodes-asg-config.png){ .svg-img .dark-img }
    </figure>

    The **Initial Number Of Media Nodes** parameter specifies the initial number of Media Nodes to deploy. The **Min Number Of Media Nodes** and **Max Number Of Media Nodes** parameters specify the minimum and maximum number of Media Nodes that you want to be deployed.

    The **Scale Target CPU** parameter specifies the target CPU utilization to trigger the scaling up or down. The goal is to keep the CPU utilization of the Media Nodes close to this value. The autoscaling policy is based on [Target Tracking Scaling Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/auto-scaling){:target=_blank}.

## Deploying the stack

Whenever you are satisfied with your Template paremeters, just click on _"Next"_ to trigger the validation process. If correct, click on _"Create"_ to start the deployment process (which will take about 7 to 12 minutes).

!!! warning

    In case of failure, it might be that some role failed to create. In this case redeploy in a new resource group and change the **Stack Name**. To remove a role in a resource group visit [Remove Azure role assignments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-remove){:target="_blank"}.

When everything is ready, you can check the output secrets on the Key Vault or by connecting through SSH to the instance:

=== "Check deployment outputs in Azure Key Vault"

    1. Go to the Key Vault created called **yourstackname-keyvault** in the Resource Group that you deployed. You can access it from the [Azure Portal Dashboard](https://portal.azure.com/#home){:target="_blank"}.

    2. Once you are in the Key Vault on the left panel click on _"Objects"_ ðŸ¡’ _"Secrets"_.

        <figure markdown>
        ![Azure Key Vault secrets location](../../../../assets/images/self-hosting/shared/azure-keyvault-secrets-location.png){ .svg-img .dark-img }
        </figure>

    3. Here click on the secret of your choice or whatever you need to check and click again in the current version of that secret

        <figure markdown>
        ![Azure Key Vault Secret Version](../../../../assets/images/self-hosting/shared/azure-keyvault-secret-version.png){ .svg-img .dark-img }
        </figure>

    4. Now you will see a lot of properties but the one you are searching for is located at the bottom and it will be revealed by clicking in _"Show Secret Value"_.

        <figure markdown>
        ![Check deployment outputs in Azure Key Vault](../../../../assets/images/self-hosting/shared/azure-keyvault-output.png){ .svg-img .dark-img }
        </figure>

=== "Check deployment outputs in the instance"

    SSH to the Master Node instance and navigate to the config folder `/opt/openvidu/config/cluster`. Files with the access credentials outputs are:

    - `openvidu.env`
    - `master_node/meet.env`

## Configure your application to use the deployment

You need your Azure deployment outputs to configure your OpenVidu application. If you have permissions to access the Key Vault you will be able to check there all the outputs ([Check deployment outputs in Azure Key Vault](#check-deployment-outputs-in-azure-key-vault)). If you don't have permissions to access the Key Vault you can still check the outputs directly in the instance through SSH ([Check deployment outputs in the instance](#check-deployment-outputs-in-the-instance)).

Your authentication credentials and URL to point your applications would be:

- Applications developed with LiveKit SDK:
    - **URL**: The value in the Key Vault Secret of `DOMAIN-NAME` or in the instance in `openvidu.env` as a URL. It could be `wss://openvidu.example.io/` or `https://openvidu.example.io/` depending on the SDK you are using.
    - **API Key**: The value in the Key Vault Secret of `LIVEKIT-API-KEY` or in the instance in `openvidu.env`.
    - **API Secret**: The value in the Key Vault Secret of `LIVEKIT-API-SECRET` or in the instance in `openvidu.env`.

- Applications developed with OpenVidu v2:
    - **URL**: The value in the Key Vault Secret of `DOMAIN-NAME` or in the instance in `openvidu.env` as a URL. For example, `https://openvidu.example.io/`.
    - **Username**: `OPENVIDUAPP`.
    - **Password**: The value in the Key Vault Secret of `LIVEKIT-API-SECRET` or in the instance in `openvidu.env`.
 
## Troubleshooting initial Azure stack creation

--8<-- "shared/self-hosting/azure-troubleshooting.md"

3. If everything seems fine, check the [status](../on-premises/admin.md#checking-the-status-of-services) and the [logs](../on-premises/admin.md#checking-logs) of the installed OpenVidu services.

## Configuration and administration

When your Azure stack reaches the **`Succeeded`** status, it means that all the resources have been created. You will need to wait about 5 to 10 minutes to let the instance install OpenVidu. When this time has elapsed, try connecting to the deployment URL. If it doesn't work, we recommend checking the previous section. Once finished you can check the [Administration](./admin.md) section to learn how to manage your deployment.
