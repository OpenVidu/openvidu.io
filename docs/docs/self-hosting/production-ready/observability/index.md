# Observability :material-microscope:

Any production software needs to be observable. But in real-time applications this becomes an absolute priority. You must be able to:

- :material-network-strength-2-alert:{.large-icon} Detect and solve networking issues that may prevent your users from connecting to your Rooms.
- :material-quality-high:{.large-icon} Monitor the quality of the video and audio streams, that will reflect in your users' experience.
- :octicons-graph-16:{.large-icon} Analyze the load in your hardware to detect bottlenecks and scale your deployment accordingly.
- :material-history:{.large-icon} Store historical data to analyze past issues and trends to make future decisions based on them.

OpenVidu brings everything you need to fulfill these requirements. We collect **events**, **metrics** and **logs** from your deployment and provide [**OpenVidu Dashboard**](openvidu-dashboard.md) and a [**Grafana stack**](grafana-stack.md) to navigate them.
