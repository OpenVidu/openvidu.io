Both OpenVidu Meet and OpenVidu Platform provide **production-grade performance, scalability, fault-tolerance and observability**. What product should you choose?

- Give [**OpenVidu Meet**](/meet/index.md) a try if your use case falls under the category of "video conferencing application": e-learning, telehealth, team collaboration, customer support, etc. Don't mistake the simplicity for a lack of possibilities: OpenVidu Meet offers branding customizations and many features out-of-the-box, such as screen-sharing, recording, broadcasting, live-captions, and more.
- Choose [**OpenVidu Platform**](/docs/index.md) if you really need total control and flexibility to build your own custom real-time app, either from scratch or integrating OpenVidu Platform into your existing app. OpenVidu Platform provides low-level WebRTC SDKs for any language, and full control over features like audio/video/data streaming, media ingestion, telephony and AI integrations.
