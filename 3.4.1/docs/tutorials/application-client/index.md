# Application Client Tutorials

Every application client below shares the same core functionality:

- Users request a LiveKit token to any [application server](../application-server/) to connect to a room.
- Users may publish their camera, microphone and screen-share.
- Users automatically subscribe to all media published by other users.
- Users may leave the room at any time.

Every application client below is interchangeable with the others, because:

- All of them are compatible with each other, meaning that participants are able to join the same LiveKit room from any of the client applications.
- All of them are compatible with any [application server](../application-server/), meaning that they can request a LiveKit token from any of the server applications.
