                outside the business sphere for which it has been acquired, or outside any of the dispositions
                stipulated in this contract. The client may not sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise sublicense the
                telematics application or take part in any act which may result in the violation of their duty of care
                and protection. The client may not assign, transfer, pledge or make any other disposition of the rights
                acquired through this contract, of any part of the contract, or of any of the rights, claims or
                obligations under the contract.</li>
            <li>The client is obligated to refrain from using the telematics application for illegal purposes or any
                other purposes contrary to what is established in the present contract, or any action that may be
                injurious to TIKAL´s rights and interests, to the owner of the telematics application, as well as to any
                third parties involved. Said actions include, but are not limited to, any deed that may harm, overload,
                disrupt, or otherwise render useless the telematics application, thus preventing other clients and users
                from making use of it.</li>
            <li>Changes to the telematics application are strictly forbidden. These include, but are not limited to,
                such things as reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, reproducing, translating, modifying,
                commercializing, cloning, transforming or transmitting to any natural or legal person, partially or
                entirely, by any means, whether mechanic, magnetic, photocopies, etc… or to eliminate or block any
                proprietary notice or logos pertaining to the telematics application. The components and elements
                subject to the aforementioned restrictions include, but are not limited to, such things as the logical
                diagrams, source codes, object and/or data model; except prior, written authorization from TIKAL. These
                restrictions stand, even when said actions where needed for the interoperability with other computer
                programs or telematics applications.</li>
            <li>The client or the user must protect and safeguard, both physically and intellectually, the telematics
                application, namely, its contents, logical procedures, and access protocols, by establishing the
                necessary means in order to guarantee the non-disclosure, cloning, reproduction, altering, translation,
                transformation, access by third parties, or any other action that shall imply a violation of the duty of
                care or of any intellectual and industrial property right.</li>
            <li>The telematics application may only be used by the client or authorized user, for processing the
                client´s own data and their products, but under no circumstances shall it be used to process third
                parties ‘data.</li>
            <li>TIKAL cannot guarantee uninterrupted access to the service throughout the entire validity period of this
                contract due to unforeseeable factors such as network issues, telecommunications service providers,
                breakdown in computers, as well as other contingencies such as repair and maintenance work, and software
                updates. Notwithstanding this, TIKAL reserves the right to adopt any necessary measures to limit the
                service, should it be considered that improper and/or irresponsible use of the telematics application is
                occurring, specially when said uses run counter to the terms and conditions provided in the present
                contract.</li>
            <li>Should the client or user breach the terms of contract, in a continuous and sustained fashion, or acting
                in bad faith, TIKAL shall terminate the provision of the service, without reimbursing any amount, on the
                grounds of abusive and improper use.</li>
            <li>Interpretation and scope. Any other right which has not been stated or directly mentioned in the present
                contract, remains reserved to TIKAL. Under no circumstances shall the terms and conditions of this
                contract be interpreted or applied in such a fashion that could be injurious to TIKAL or in any manner
                that runs counter to the regular exploitation framework of a telematics application.</li>
        </ol>
    </span>

    <h3>Fourth. Liability.</h3>
    <span>
        <ol>
            <li>TIKAL´s telematics application is access-ready in its current state and configuration. Should the
                application contain any deficiency attributable to TIKAL TECHNOLOGIES SL, the latter pledges to make use
                of all the resources available to them in order to solve the issue as promptly as possible. Nonetheless,
                it declines any liability and does not give any guarantee regarding violations perpetrated by third
                parties, marketability, satisfactory quality or suitability for a specific purpose.</li>
            <li>TIKAL shall act with due diligence and professionalism by making use of all its resources available so
                as to ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the telematics application. In any case, TIKAL´s
                assumes no liability for any damages, direct or indirect, incidental or special, including, but not
                limited to, such things as damages or financial loss, work disruptions, failure, breakdown, or any
                losses, even when the possibility of such inconveniences occurring, which include third-party
                complaints, were previously notified to a member of TIKAL´s staff.</li>
            <li>The client accepts, within reason, to tolerate specific, isolated disruptions in connectivity and hereby
                forfeits the right to claim any liability, contractual or otherwise, as well as damages owing to
                possible failures, slowness or access errors. TIKAL declines any liability concerning data loss,
                accidental or otherwise, resulting from the client´s actions or activities.</li>
            <li>The client or user is solely responsible for the provision and payment of the costs necessary to ensure
                compatibility between the telematics application and their equipment, including all hardware, software,
                electronic components, and any other component required to access the telematics application, these
                include, but are not limited to, such things as telecommunication services, Internet access and
                connectivity, operating systems, or any other program, equipment or services, required to access and use
                the telematics application.</li>
            <li>TIKAL declines any liability regarding any content that the client or user may host within the
                telematics application OpenVidu Pro, since at no moment, does TIKAL intervene in the internal processing
                of said content. Therefore, and in accordance with art.16 of LSSI-CE, TIKAL is not legally bound to
                remove any content from the server, provided there is no “actual knowledge” that the activity or
                information stored is illegal, libellous, or injurious to third-party rights or assets. In this regard,
                it shall be understood that “actual knowledge” exits, when there is a court or administrative decision,
                ordering to block or remove content and that the contractor (TIKAL) has been made aware of it.
                Notwithstanding, TIKAL reserves the right to remove this type of content out of its own volition, once
                it has been detected, whilst the client waives any right to claim or demand compensation. Should the
                application be in any way damaged due to the introduction of malign software or content (virus,
                trojan,…) TIKAL reserves the right to automatically terminate the contract without having to pay any
                compensation whatsoever. On the other hand, TIKAL hereby reserves the right to demand compensation from
                the client or user for any damages caused to the system.</li>
            <li>The client or user shall burden all legal costs incurred when the cause is attributable to them, these
                include TIKAL lawyers’ fees, even when a final court decision has yet to be reached.</li>
            <li>TIKAL uses information security protocols which are broadly accepted and observed by the industry such
                as firewalls, access-control procedures, and crypto mechanisms in order to avoid any unauthorized access
                to the data. For this purpose, the client hereby grants TIKAL access to data so that it can perform
                access-control authentication. The licensing process or any process which entails the introduction of
                personal data shall always conducted under a rigorous communication protocol so as to ensure no third
                parties have access to data transmitted electronically.</li>
        </ol>
    </span>

    <h3>Fifth. Intellectual and industrial property rights.</h3>

    <span>
        <ol>
            <li>The exploitation rights of the telematics application are owned by TIKAL and protected by Spanish
                Intellectual Property Laws applicable in any country where it is used. The structure, organization and
                coding of the telematics application constitute confidential and valuable industrial and commercial
                secrets which belong to TIKAL. Therefore, the client must treat the telematics application in the same
                fashion they would when utilizing any material protected by intellectual property rights, thus copying,
                duplicating, or cloning the application is strictly forbidden. </li>
            <li>The present licence to use the telematics application does not imply, either explicitly or implicitly,
                the assignment of the intellectual and industrial rights over said application, the hardware, or the
                data model.</li>
            <li>Brands must be utilized in accordance with the commercial uses of brands, including acknowledging the
                proprietor’s name of the brand. Brands may only be used in order identify those printouts produced by
                the telematics application. Said utilization does not imply or grant any property rights over the
                application.</li>
            <li>The knowledge and expertise intrinsic to the telematics application, as well as the knowledge utilized
                to configure it, is confidential information which belongs to the owner of the telematics application
                TIKAL. The client acknowledges this and assumes all liability regarding fraudulent use, or illegal copy
                or duplication of said application, or complementary programs, or utilization of this information by
                third parties, being liable for any breach of the present contract, by them or by any person or persons
                depending or associated with the client, or when these individuals have been granted access, directly or
                indirectly, to the telematics application by the client.</li>
            <li>Updates: For the entire validity period of the present contract, and in accordance with the terms and
                conditions stipulated in the next paragraph, the client is entitled to have access to the updates of the
                telematics application as they arise. The client assumes all legal liability for the updates, regarding
                limitations and duty of care, in the same fashion as with the original computer application. Updates to
                additional modules of the telematics application shall be given to those clients who have acquired from
                TIKAL the licence to use said modules.</li>
            <li>Hereby the client gives TIKAL consent to incorporate them as such into their business portfolio, thus
                allowing TIKAL to use their brand and logo on its website as well as in documents which may be given to
                other potential clients, for the sole purpose of said portfolio, and provided that the client does not
                express opposition to them being used in such a fashion.</li>
        </ol>
    </span>

    <h3>Sixth. Right to amend.</h3>

    <span>
        TIKAL reserves the right to update the telematics application to the latest version available on the market.
        Said updates may include, but are not limited to, such things as new functionalities, improvements, and
        modifications and legal updates to the telematics application, which may vary, at any moment such things as its
        features, performance, and configuration of the telematics application content.
    </span><br><br>
    <span>
        TIKAL pledges to evaluate and take into consideration suggestions and requests made by clients and users of the
        telematics application so that they may be incorporated in the new versions of said application; however, it is
        TIKAL´s right, not the client´s to decide which modifications or improvements may be included in the
        aforementioned versions.
    </span><br><br>
    <span>
        TIKAL reserves the right to modify, at any moment, the characteristics, features, and conditions of TIKAL for
        the benefit and development of the service. With this in mind, TIKAL may only have to observe the formality of
        having to notify the client via an on-line notice, or by modifying any clause in this contract.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, TIKAL shall endeavour to promptly notify the client so that the latter may adapt
        them.
    </span>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The exclusion clause, or termination of this contract, does not imply that TIKAL forfeits the right to
                take legal actions or file for financial compensation when the client has acted in bad faith to damage,
                directly or indirectly, the telematics application.</li>

                only one). In general terms, the client pledges to keep their personal details updated, and must
                communicate TIKAL, in a clear, unambiguous manner, of any changes.</li>

                re-establish the service as promptly as possible from the moment it is notified that the debt has been
                settled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TIKAL reserves the right to ask for a two-month deposit as a
                guarantee before re-establishing the service. The client accepts all liability for any legal costs
                incurred due to claims made by TIKAL regarding breach of payment after the contract has reached its
                expiry date, including, but not limited to, such things as the return of invoices and late-payment
                interest.<br>
                When the client returns, for any cause alien to TIKAL, two or more direct-debit invoices, TIKAL shall be
                entitled to unilaterally opt for the annual hiring and billing of the service.</li>
            <li>When the client has defaulted on a payment, either totally or partially, during three months, for the
                amount owed to TIKAL, the latter has the right to rescind the contract between the two parties, as well
                as the direct and definite termination and cancellation of the service hired by the client, including
                the database linked to the client´s services, without prior notice from TIKAL.</li>
            <li>TIKAL shall apply upon its rates any current deals and offers existing at the time the client hires the
                service, provided they comply with the terms and conditions of said deals and offers so that they may
                benefit from them. The client acknowledges and accepts the fact they may obtain detailed information, at
                any given time, regarding said deals and offers on TIKAL´s website or through the habitual communication
                channels with which TIKAL provides its clients.</li>

    <h3>Eleventh. Data Protection.</h3>

    <span>
        The parties involved agree that they know, comply with, and are subject to, the Spanish and European laws and
        legislation regarding Personal Data Protection, thus they must give proper use and treatment to all data arising
        from any activity subjected to the terms and conditions of this contract.
    </span>

    <h4>Data Controller agreement between the client and TIKAL.</h4>

    <span>In accordance with the Spanish Data Protection Laws, TIKAL´s access to the client´s personal files shall not
        be considered a violation of said laws, insofar as TIKAL is effectively the Data Controller and said access is
        necessary for the provision of the service which is the subject of this contract.</span><br><br>

    <span>In this regard, and for the purposes of Data Protection regulation, TIKAL shall be regarded as the “Data
        Controller” of the client´s data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TIKAL pledges that it shall treat said data in
        conformity with the client´s instructions provided in this contract, and that under no circumstances shall it
        utilise them for any other purposes outside of what the parties have agreed in this contract, nor shall it
        transfer or communicate them to a third party, not even for back-up or storage purposes. At the same time, the
        duration and validity of this agreement shall correspond to the type of service hired by the
        client.</span><br><br>

    <span>Once the provision of said service terminates and the data shall no longer be necessary to perform the
        aforementioned Data Controller role, all personal data shall be either destroyed or returned to the person,
        persons or entity responsible for it, as well as any storage medium, documents or files containing personal
        data.<br><br>
        In order to provide the service and what said provision entails, TIKAL shall be granted access to the following

                its treatment, or in cases provided for by the law.</li>
            <li>TIKAL may not outsource, either totally or partially, the provision of the service(s) described in the
                present contract, except prior authorization from the client whom shall be informed with due notice
                about the outsourcing entity as well as the services being outsourced. In this case, TIKAL shall draft
                and execute a new contract with said outsourcing entity, always in accordance with the current Data
                Protection laws.</li>

                confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems and services concerning data protection, as
                well as to restore the access and availability to data in case of system failure. Additionally, it is
                endowed with capabilities so as to regularly verify and assess the efficacy of the security protocol.

    <h3>Twelfth. Confidentiality.</h3>

    <span>
        <ol>
            <li>All data and information transmitted between the parties is strictly confidential and property of TIKAL
                and the client, and its protection is of the utmost importance. To this intent, both parties hereby
                contract the obligation to safeguard said data and information by adopting all appropriate measures to
                ensure that only authorized individuals shall have access to it; authorized individuals being understood
                as those employees which are needed by the parties involved so as to keep the provision of the service,
                which is the object of this contract, in good working order.</li>
            <li>In this regard, the signatory parties are hereby subject to the following confidential agreement:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hereby TIKAL pledges to keep confidential all data and information supplied by, and concerning
                        the client, as well as the output arisen from the service provided. In this regard, TIKAL
                        possesses strict internal controls whose objective and end are to guarantee the integrity of the
                        present confidential agreement.</li>
                    <li>The client therefore agrees to keep confidential all data and information arising from TIKAL´s
                        internal processes, specially the existence, utilization, and functionalities of any process
                        used in the provision of the service.</li>
                    <li>The present confidential agreement shall remain valid even after the termination of the present
                        contractual relation and extends indefinitely to all members of staff that have been granted
                        access to said confidential information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </span>

    <h3>Thirteenth. Termination. Rescission. Nullity.</h3>

    <span>
        <ol>
            <li>The present contract shall be considered void for infringement, committed by any of the parties
                involved, of the Spanish Civil Code, and in particular, of the Spanish Commercial Code, and the
                obligations arising from the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mutual consent of the parties involved.</li>
                    <li>When the present contract has reached its expiry date which is specified in clause tenth, or
                        within the subsequent extensions thereof.</li>
                    <li>By unilateral rescission provided that the party wishing to rescind communicates this at least
                        one month in advance.</li>
                    <li>When any of the parties has been officially put into administration, has filed for bankruptcy
                        protection, is under bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or is under liquidation or
                        dissolution.</li>
                    <li>Due to any other reason(s) provided for in law.</li>
                    <li>Should any of the parties involved breach the contracted obligations provided in the present
                        contract, the other party may consider it as void. Said consideration warrants no prior notice
                        or compensation of any kind, but for the need to communicate the decision to the other party;
                        unless the unaccrued obligations owed by the party are performed within the next fifteen days,
                        counting from the moment said party was notified that they are in breach of the contract .
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the other party reserves the right to claim or file for damages
                        caused by this infringement.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>TIKAL pledges to destroy all data provided by the client once the contractual relation is extinguished.
                Likewise, TIKAL shall destroy or return any document or storage medium containing any IT-related data
                arising from said contractual relation. Once said contractual relation terminates, the client may
                request TIKAL to supply them with a hard, back-up copy of all data pertaining to and arising from said
                relation, to any address the client wishes, prior to a written request to do so, which must be sent
                within the week after the end of the contract. The client shall burden the costs incurred arising from
                the handling and mailing of said request.</li>
            <li>The client may cease or cancel the use of the telematics application whenever they wish to do so. Should
                the client or any authorized user by them request the cancellation of the service at TIKAL´s offices, it
                shall become effective on the same day said request was made. Therefore, it is advised to carefully
                observe said process to avoid any resources or data loss that the client or user may have in their
                TIKAL´s account. Should it not be possible for them to initiate said cancellation process at TIKAL´s
                offices, the client may request it by contacting TIKAL´s customer service via any of the channels
                provided in this contract. Said cancellation shall become effective on the day stipulated by the client,
                provided that the request has been made with enough time to be processed correctly.</li>
        </ol>
