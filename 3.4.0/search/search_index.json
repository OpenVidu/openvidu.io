These modules are independent of LiveKit Server and must be correctly configured and connected via a shared Redis. When running OpenVidu Community you will have all these services properly integrated, so you can focus on developing your app without worrying about anything else.</li> <li>S3 compatible storage for Egress recordings: OpenVidu Community comes with an S3 compatible storage already configured to store Egress  recordings (Minio ).</li> <li>Administration dashboard to monitor your Rooms: OpenVidu comes with an administration dashboard that allows you to monitor the status of your Rooms. Not only in real time, but also historically: the number of participants, the number of published tracks, Egress and Ingress processes... This is a great tool to have when developing your app, as it can help to spot issues and debugging your application's logic.

You can find the release notes here .</li> <li>OpenVidu Single Node native deployment in Google Cloud Platform (GCP): you can now deploy OpenVidu Single Node in GCP using its native resources thanks to our new Terraform template. Follow the GCP deployment guide. Templates for OpenVidu Elastic and OpenVidu High Availability in GCP are coming soon.</li> <li>No need for a domain name to deploy OpenVidu in production: thanks to sslip.io  integration, you can now deploy OpenVidu in production with a valid SSL certificate without owning a custom domain name. Just deploy OpenVidu 3.4.0 and skip the domain name configuration during the installation process: OpenVidu will automatically detect your public IP and provide a secure domain name using sslip.io.</li> <li>OpenVidu agents new configurations: configure a custom CPU threshold to accept new jobs, and modify the agent's log level. See Change CPU load threshold and Log level.</li> <li>Custom AI agents now natively support graceful shutdown, ensuring no interruptions in the services provided by your custom agents when your OpenVidu cluster scales down.</li> <li>OpenVidu Dashboard optimizations: the addition of several new search indexes to the database has significantly improved the response time of the OpenVidu Dashboard when loading historical data.</li> <li>Fixed bug that caused empty <code>participantInfo</code> object when receiving transcription events using the Speech Processing agent.

Once connected, the client becomes a Participant of the Room.</li> <li>Publish Tracks to the Room: the application client may create Tracks of any kind (audio from the microphone, video from the camera device, screen sharing from an application...) and publish them to the Room.</li> <li>Subscribe to Tracks from other Participants: the application client may receive the Tracks published by other Participants in the Room. It is possible to perform selective subscription, so the client can choose which Tracks to specifically subscribe to.</li> <li>Mute and unmute Tracks: the application client may mute and unmute its own Tracks, and also may disable the reception of any Track published by other Participants.</li> </ul> <p>Of course, depending on the use case, this may not be necessary for all users, or other additional steps may need to be taken. For example, in a live-streaming application, only presenters will publish Tracks, while all other viewers will only subscribe to them.

When using LiveKit Open Source, this isn't an issue if you access your app from the same computer where the LiveKit Server is running, as <code>localhost</code> is considered a secure context even over plain HTTP. Consider the following architecture:</p> <p>The simplest way to test your application is:</p> <ol> <li>Run LiveKit Server on your computer.</li> <li>Connect your app to LiveKit Server through <code>localhost</code>.</li> <li>Serve both your application client and server from the same computer.</li> <li>Access your app from <code>localhost</code> in a browser on the same computer.</li> </ol> <p>This setup is straightforward, but what if you need to test your app from multiple devices simultaneously, including real mobile devices? In this case, you must use a secure context (HTTPS), which introduces two challenges:</p> <ol> <li>LiveKit Server open source does not natively support HTTPS. You'll need a reverse proxy to serve LiveKit Server over HTTPS.</li> <li>Even with HTTPS, your SSL certificate might not be valid for local network addresses. You'll need to accept it in the browser for web apps, and install it on mobile devices.</li> </ol> <p>OpenVidu Local Deployment addresses these issues by providing a magic domain name <code>openvidu-local.dev</code> that resolves to any IP specified as a subdomain and provides a valid wildcard certificate for HTTPS. This is similar to services like nip.io , traefik.me, or localtls.</p> <p>When using OpenVidu Local Deployment, you can access OpenVidu Server (which is 100% LiveKit compatible) and your app from any device on your local network with a valid HTTPS certificate. The following table shows the URLs to access the deployment and your application locally and from other devices on your network:</p> Local access Access from devices in your local network Usage Access only from the development machine Access from any device connected to your local network. In the URLs below, replace <code>xxx-yyy-zzz-www</code> with the local IP address of the development machine, replacing the dots (<code>.</code>) with dashes (<code>-</code>).

For example: <code>3.4.0</code>.</p> <p>A wizard will guide you through the installation process. You will be asked for the following information:</p> <ul> <li>Write the 'Master Node' Private IP: Write the private IP of the machine where you are going to install the Master Node.</li> <li>Write your OpenVidu PRO License: Write your OpenVidu PRO License.</li> </ul> <p>Info</p> <p>If you don't have a license key for OpenVidu PRO, you can get a 15-day free trial license key by creating an OpenVidu account.</p> <ul> <li>Domain name (Optional): The domain name for your deployment. If left empty, an autogenerated domain using sslip.io (e.g., <code>10-20-30-40.sslip.io</code>) will be used based on your Master Node's public IP. For production environments, it's recommended to provide your own FQDN.</li> <li> <p>Select which certificate type to use:</p> <ul> <li>Self Signed Certificate: It will generate a self-signed certificate. It is not recommended for production environments, but it is useful for testing or development purposes.</li> <li>Let's Encrypt: It will automatically generate a certificate for your domain. The Let's Encrypt email is required and will be asked later in the wizard.</li> <li>ZeroSSL: It will automatically generate a certificate for your domain using ZeroSSL. An API Key is required and will be asked later in the wizard.</li> <li>Own Certificate: It will ask you for the certificate and key files. Just copy and paste the content of the files when the wizard asks for them.</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>If you want to manage the certificate in your proxy own proxy server instead of relaying in the Caddy server deployed with OpenVidu, take a look to this How-to guide: How to deploy OpenVidu with an external proxy.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Turn domain name: The domain name for your TURN server with TLS.

This ensures that traffic for these services is properly routed to the Media Nodes.</p> <p>Below is an example using NGINX as a Load Balancer:</p> NGINX Load Balancer ConfigurationNGINX Load Balancer Configuration (With TLS for TURN) <p>Example configuration for NGINX Load Balancer:</p> <pre><code>events {\n    worker_connections 10240;\n}\n\n# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS\nhttp {\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        listen [::]:80;\n        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n    }\n}\n\nstream {\n\n    upstream api_backend {\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_1&gt;:7880;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_2&gt;:7880;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_3&gt;:7880;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_4&gt;:7880;\n    }\n\n    upstream rtmp_backend {\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_1&gt;:1945;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_2&gt;:1945;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_3&gt;:1945;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_4&gt;:1945;\n    }\n\n    # Proxy for API and TURN\n    server {\n        listen 443 ssl;\n        listen [::]:443 ssl;\n        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\n\n        proxy_connect_timeout 10s;\n        proxy_timeout 30s;\n\n        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/openvidu-cert.pem;\n        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/openvidu-key.pem;\n\n        proxy_pass api_backend;\n    }\n\n    # RTMP\n    server {\n        listen 1935 ssl;\n        listen [::]:1935 ssl;\n        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\n\n        proxy_connect_timeout 10s;\n        proxy_timeout 30s;\n\n        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/openvidu-cert.pem;\n        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/openvidu-key.pem;\n\n        proxy_pass rtmp_backend;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Notice that <code>openvidu-cert.pem</code> and <code>openvidu-key.pem</code> must be valid SSL certificates for your domain. </li> <li>The domain name should be pointing to the NGINX Load Balancer.</li> <li>Replace <code>&lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_X&gt;</code> with the private IP addresses of your Master Nodes and <code>&lt;MEDIA_NODE_IP_X&gt;</code> with the private IP addresses of your Media Nodes.</li> </ul> <p>Example configuration for NGINX Load Balancer:</p> <pre><code>events {\n    worker_connections 10240;\n}\n\n# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS\nhttp {\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        listen [::]:80;\n        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n    }\n}\n\nstream {\n\n    upstream api_backend {\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_1&gt;:7880;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_2&gt;:7880;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_3&gt;:7880;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_4&gt;:7880;\n    }\n\n    upstream turn_backend {\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_1&gt;:5349;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_2&gt;:5349;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_3&gt;:5349;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_4&gt;:5349;\n    }\n\n    upstream rtmp_backend {\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_1&gt;:1945;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_2&gt;:1945;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_3&gt;:1945;\n        server &lt;MASTER_NODE_IP_4&gt;:1945;\n    }\n\n    # Use SNI to determine which upstream server to proxy to\n    map $ssl_server_name $upstream {\n        openvidu.example.com api_backend;\n        turn.example.com turn_backend;\n    }\n\n    # Use SNI to determine which certificate to use\n    map $ssl_server_name $certificate {\n        openvidu.example.com /etc/nginx/ssl/openvidu-cert.pem;\n        turn.example.com /etc/nginx/ssl/turn-cert.pem;\n    }\n\n    # Use SNI to determine which private key to use\n    map $ssl_server_name $private_key {\n        openvidu.example.com /etc/nginx/ssl/openvidu-key.pem;\n        turn.example.com /etc/nginx/ssl/turn-key.pem;\n    }\n\n    # Proxy for API and TURN\n    server {\n        listen 443 ssl;\n        listen [::]:443 ssl;\n        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\n\n        proxy_connect_timeout 10s;\n        proxy_timeout 30s;\n\n        ssl_certificate $certificate;\n        ssl_certificate_key $private_key;\n\n        proxy_pass $upstream;\n    }\n\n    # RTMP\n    server {\n        listen 1935 ssl;\n        listen [::]:1935 ssl;\n        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\n\n        proxy_connect_timeout 10s;\n        proxy_timeout 30s;\n\n        ssl_certificate /certs/domain_fullchain.pem;\n        ssl_certificate_key /certs/domain_privkey.pem;\n\n        proxy_pass rtmp_backend;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Notice that <code>openvidu.example.com</code> is the domain name you have chosen for your OpenVidu deployment and <code>turn.example.com</code> is the domain name you have chosen for your TURN with TLS.

Prerequisites</p> <p>To deploy OpenVidu with an external proxy, ensure you have the following prerequisites:</p> <ul> <li>A machine with at least 4GB RAM and 4 CPU cores and Linux installed (Ubuntu recommended). This machine will serve as the OpenVidu server.</li> <li>An additional machine for the proxy server is recommended. Alternatively, you can use the same machine as OpenVidu, but be aware that the proxy server will consume resources. Note that some ports will be used by OpenVidu, except for the ports utilized by the proxy server (TCP 80, 443, and 1935).</li> <li>Generous disk space (100GB recommended) if you are going to record your sessions.</li> <li>The machine where OpenVidu is installed must have a Public IP or a reachable IP from the users.</li> <li>The proxy server also must have a Public IP or a reachable IP from the users.</li> <li>A domain name for your OpenVidu deployment pointing to the machine where the proxy server is running. In this guide, we will use <code>openvidu.example.io</code>.</li> <li>Optionally (but recommended), you need an additional domain name pointing to the proxy machine where the proxy server is running. It will be used for TURN with TLS which is useful in case your users are behind restrictive firewalls to be able to connect to OpenVidu. In this guide, we will use <code>turn.example.io</code>.</li> </ul> <p>2. Port Rules</p> <p>You can follow the same rule ports of the Single Node Deployment but some ports are used by the proxy server and others are not needed. The inbound rules for the OpenVidu proxy would be as follows:</p> OpenVidu MachineProxy Server <p>Inbound Rules</p> Protocol Ports Source Description TCP 7880 External proxy Allows access to the following: <ul><li>LiveKit API.</li><li>OpenVidu Dashboard.</li><li>OpenVidu Meet.</li><li>WHIP API.</li><li>Custom layouts</li></ul> TCP 1945 External proxy Needed if you want to ingest RTMP streams using Ingress service.

We recommend you to read the Elastic Deployment guide before proceeding with this guide to have a better understanding of the deployment.</p> <p>This is how the architecture of the deployment looks like:</p> <p></p> OpenVidu Elastic On Premises Architecture with External Proxy <p></p> <p>1. Prerequisites</p> <p>To deploy OpenVidu Elastic with an external proxy, ensure you have the following prerequisites:</p> <ul> <li>At least 2 machines for OpenVidu, each with a minimum of 4GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, and Linux installed (Ubuntu is recommended). One machine will serve as the Master Node, while the others will function as Media Nodes.</li> <li>An additional machine for the proxy server is recommended. Alternatively, you can use the same machine as the Master Node, but be aware that the proxy server will consume resources. Note that some ports will be used by OpenVidu, except for the ports utilized by the proxy server (TCP 80, 443, and 1935).</li> <li>Significant disk space on the Master Node, with 100GB recommended, especially if you plan to record your sessions (Egress). Media Nodes require less space; however, account for the space needed for ongoing recordings on these nodes.</li> <li>Each machine must have a Public IP or a reachable IP from the users.</li> <li>The proxy server must have a Public IP or a reachable IP from the users.</li> <li>A domain name for your OpenVidu deployment pointing to the proxy server. In this guide, we will use <code>openvidu.example.io</code>.</li> <li>Optionally (but recommended), you need an additional domain name pointing to the proxy server. It will be used for TURN with TLS which is useful in case your users are behind restrictive firewalls. In this guide, we will use <code>turn.example.io</code>.</li> </ul> <p>2. Port Rules</p> <p>You can follow the same rule ports of the Elastic Deployment for the Master Node and for the Media Nodes but some ports are used by the proxy server and others are not needed. The inbound rules for the OpenVidu proxy would be as follows:</p> Master NodeMedia NodesProxy Server <p>Inbound Rules</p> Protocol Ports Source Description TCP 7880 External Proxy Allows access to the following: <ul><li>Livekit API.</li><li>OpenVidu v2 Compatibility API</li><li>OpenVidu Dashboard.</li><li>OpenVidu Meet.</li><li>WHIP API.</li><li>Custom layouts</li></ul> TCP 1935 External Proxy Needed if you want to ingest RTMP streams using Ingress service. TCP 5349 External proxy Optional and needed only if you have a domain for TURN and you want to use TURN with TLS TCP 4443 Media Nodes Needed when 'OpenVidu v2 Compatibility' module is used (<code>v2compatibility</code> in <code>ENABLED_MODULES</code> global parameter). Media Nodes need access to this port to reach OpenVidu V2 compatibility service TCP 6080 Media Nodes Needed when 'OpenVidu Meet'  module is used (<code>openviduMeet</code> in <code>ENABLED_MODULES</code> global parameter). Media Nodes need access to this port to reach OpenVidu Meet. TCP 3100 Media Nodes Needed when 'Observability' module is used (<code>observability</code> in <code>ENABLED_MODULES</code> global parameter) Media Nodes need access to this port to reach Loki. TCP 9009 Media Nodes Needed when 'Observability' module is used. (<code>observability</code> in <code>ENABLED_MODULES</code> global parameter) Media Nodes need access to this port to reach Mimir. TCP 7000 Media Nodes Media Nodes need access to this port to reach Redis Service. TCP 9100 Media Nodes Media Nodes need access to this port to reach MinIO. TCP 20000 Media Nodes Media Nodes need access to this port to reach MongoDB. <p>Outbound Rules</p> <p>Typically, all outbound traffic is allowed.</p> <p>Inbound Rules</p> Protocol Ports Source Description UDP 443 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 STUN/TURN over UDP.

TCP 1935 Master Node Needed if you want to ingest RTMP streams using Ingress service. Master Node needs access to this port to reach Ingress RTMP service and expose it using TLS (RTMPS). TCP 5349 Master Node Needed if you have configured TURN with a domain for TLS. Master Node needs access to this port to reach TURN service and expose it using TLS (TURNS). TCP 7880 Master Node LiveKit API. Master Node needs access to load balance LiveKit API and expose it through HTTPS. TCP 8080 Master Node Needed if you want to ingest WebRTC streams using WHIP. Master Node needs access to this port to reach WHIP HTTP service. <p>Outbound Rules</p> <p>Typically, all outbound traffic is allowed.</p> <p>And the inbound rules for the proxy server would be as follows:</p> Protocol Ports Source Description TCP 80 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 HTTP redirection to HTTPS.

Install OpenVidu Elastic with <code>--external-proxy</code> flag</p> <p>To deploy OpenVidu Elastic with an external proxy, you must use the CLI installation command with the <code>--external-proxy</code> flag. The command to install OpenVidu Elastic with an external proxy is as follows:</p> Install Master NodeInstall Media Nodes <pre><code>sh &lt;(curl -fsSL http://get.openvidu.io/pro/elastic/latest/install_ov_master_node.sh) \\\n    --no-tty --install \\\n    --node-role='master-node' \\\n    --openvidu-pro-license='xxxxx' \\\n    --domain-name='openvidu.example.io' \\\n    --turn-domain-name='turn.example.io' \\\n    --enabled-modules='observability,v2compatibility,openviduMeet' \\\n    --rtc-engine='pion' \\\n    --livekit-api-key='xxxxx' \\\n    --livekit-api-secret='xxxxx' \\\n    --dashboard-admin-user='xxxxx' \\\n    --dashboard-admin-password='xxxxx' \\\n    --redis-password='xxxxx' \\\n    --minio-access-key='xxxxx' \\\n    --minio-secret-key='xxxxx' \\\n    --mongo-admin-user='xxxxx' \\\n    --mongo-admin-password='xxxxx' \\\n    --mongo-replica-set-key='xxxxx' \\\n    --grafana-admin-user='xxxxx' \\\n    --grafana-admin-password='xxxxx' \\\n    --meet-initial-admin-password='xxxxx' \\\n    --meet-initial-api-key='xxxxx' \\\n    --private-ip='&lt;MASTER_NODE_PRIVATE_IP&gt;' \\\n    --external-proxy\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>In case you want to deploy a specific version, just replace <code>latest</code> with the desired version.

You can get a 15-day free trial license key by creating an OpenVidu account.</li> <li>Replace <code>openvidu.example.io</code> with your FQDN.</li> <li>The <code>turn-domain-name</code> parameter is optional. You define it only if you want to enable TURN with TLS in case users are behind restrictive firewalls. If you don't have a TURN server, you can remove it from the command. If you want to use TURN with TLS, replace <code>turn.example.io</code> with your TURN server FQDN.</li> <li><code>--private-ip</code> is very important. It should not change and Media Nodes should be able to reach the Master Node using this IP. Replace <code>&lt;MASTER_NODE_PRIVATE_IP&gt;</code> with the private IP of the Master Node.</li> <li>Depending on the RTC engine, the argument <code>--rtc-engine</code> can be <code>pion</code> or <code>mediasoup</code>.</li> </ul> <p>To install a Media Node, you can use the following command:</p> <pre><code>sh &lt;(curl -fsSL http://get.openvidu.io/pro/elastic/latest/install_ov_media_node.sh) \\\n    --no-tty --install \\\n    --node-role='media-node' \\\n    --master-node-private-ip='&lt;MASTER_NODE_PRIVATE_IP&gt;' \\\n    --redis-password='xxxxx'\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>In case you want to deploy a specific version, just replace <code>latest</code> with the desired version. For example: <code>3.4.0</code>.</p> <ul> <li>The <code>--master-node-private-ip</code> is the private IP of the Master Node. Replace <code>&lt;MASTER_NODE_PRIVATE_IP&gt;</code> with the private IP of the Master Node.</li> <li>The <code>--redis-password</code> is the password used to connect to the Redis service. Replace <code>xxxxx</code> with the same password used in the Master Node installation.</li> </ul> <p>4. Configure the external proxy</p> <p>We will use Nginx  as the proxy server, but the configuration can be adapted to other proxy servers. The configuration for the proxy server is as follows:</p> Nginx ConfigurationNginx Configuration (withouth optional TURN domain) <p>If you have installed OpenVidu with both domains (<code>openvidu.example.io</code> and <code>turn.example.io</code>) and both domains are pointing to the same proxy, the proxy needs to be configured as a Layer 4 proxy (TCP) because the TURN and HTTP traffic share the same port (443). We will use the Server Name Indication (SNI) of the TLS handshake to discern the traffic.

When these newly introduced buttons are interacted with, the client triggers requests to the REST API endpoints of the server application.</p> <p>In order to update the user interface of all participants in the room according to the recording status, the client application subscribes to the <code>RoomEvent.RecordingStatusChanged</code> event, which is triggered when the room changes from being recorded to not being recorded, and vice versa. When this event is triggered, the <code>updateRecordingInfo</code> function is called to update the recording information of the room displayed on the screen. This function is also called when a participant joins the room, using the current value of the <code>room.recording</code> property at that moment. This is done in the <code>joinRoom</code> function of the <code>app.js</code> file:</p> <p>Limitations of the <code>RoomEvent.RecordingStatusChanged</code> event</p> <p>By using the <code>RoomEvent.RecordingStatusChanged</code> event, we can only detect when the recording has started or stopped, but not other states like <code>starting</code>, <code>stopping</code> or <code>failed</code>. Additionally, when the recording stops, the event is not triggered until the recorder participant leaves the room, causing a delay of 20 seconds approximately between the stop and when participants are notified.</p> <p>To overcome these limitations, you can follow the steps described in the advanced recording tutorial, where we implement a custom notification system. This system informs participants about the recording status by listening to webhook events and updating room metadata.</p> app.js<pre><code>async function joinRoom() {\n  // Disable 'Join' button\n  document.getElementById(\"join-button\").disabled = true;\n  document.getElementById(\"join-button\").innerText = \"Joining...\";\n\n  // Initialize a new Room object\n  room = new LivekitClient.Room();\n\n  // Specify the actions when events take place in the room\n  // On every new Track received...\n  room.on(\n    LivekitClient.RoomEvent.TrackSubscribed,\n    (track, _publication, participant) =&gt; {\n      addTrack(track, participant.identity);\n    }\n  );\n\n  // On every new Track destroyed...\n  room.on(\n    LivekitClient.RoomEvent.TrackUnsubscribed,\n    (track, _publication, participant) =&gt; {\n      track.detach();\n      document.getElementById(track.sid)?.remove();\n\n      if (track.kind === \"video\") {\n        removeVideoContainer(participant.identity);\n      }\n    }\n  );\n\n  // When recording status changes...\n  room.on(\n    LivekitClient.RoomEvent.RecordingStatusChanged,\n    async (isRecording) =&gt; {\n      await updateRecordingInfo(isRecording);\n    }\n  );\n\n  try {\n    // Get the room name and participant name from the form\n    const roomName = document.getElementById(\"room-name\").value;\n    const userName = document.getElementById(\"participant-name\").value;\n\n    // Get a token from your application server with the room name and participant name\n    const token = await getToken(roomName, userName);\n\n    // Connect to the room with the LiveKit URL and the token\n    await room.connect(LIVEKIT_URL, token);\n\n    // Hide the 'Join room' page and show the 'Room' page\n    document.getElementById(\"room-title\").innerText = roomName;\n    document.getElementById(\"join\").hidden = true;\n    document.getElementById(\"room\").hidden = false;\n\n    // Publish your camera and microphone\n    await room.localParticipant.enableCameraAndMicrophone();\n    const localVideoTrack = this.room.localParticipant.videoTrackPublications\n      .values()\n      .next().value.track;\n    addTrack(localVideoTrack, userName, true);\n\n    // Update recording info\n    await updateRecordingInfo(room.isRecording);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log(\"There was an error connecting to the room:\", error.message);\n    await leaveRoom();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>updateRecordingInfo</code> function updates the recording information of the room by changing the recording button's text and color according to the recording status. It also shows or hides the alert message that informs the user that the room is being recorded. Finally, it updates the recording list by calling the <code>listRecordings</code> function.</p> <p>This function retrieves all recordings available for the room from the backend and displays their relevant information by invoking the <code>showRecordingList</code> function:</p> app.js<pre><code>function showRecordingList(recordings) {\n  const recordingsList = document.getElementById(\"recording-list\");\n\n  if (recordings.length === 0) {\n    recordingsList.innerHTML = \"&lt;span&gt;There are no recordings available&lt;/span&gt;\";\n  } else {\n    recordingsList.innerHTML = \"\";\n  }\n\n  recordings.forEach((recording) =&gt; {\n    const recordingName = recording.name;\n\n    const recordingContainer = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    recordingContainer.className = \"recording-container\";\n    recordingContainer.id = recordingName;\n\n    recordingContainer.innerHTML = `\n            &lt;i class=\"fa-solid fa-file-video\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"recording-info\"&gt;\n                &lt;p class=\"recording-name\"&gt;${recordingName}&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"recording-actions\"&gt;\n                &lt;button title=\"Play\" class=\"icon-button\" onclick=\"displayRecording('${recordingName}')\"&gt;\n                    &lt;i class=\"fa-solid fa-play\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n                &lt;/button&gt;\n                &lt;button title=\"Delete\" class=\"icon-button delete-button\" onclick=\"deleteRecording('${recordingName}')\"&gt;\n                    &lt;i class=\"fa-solid fa-trash\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n                &lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        `;\n\n    recordingsList.append(recordingContainer);\n  });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>showRecordingList</code> function creates a new <code>div</code> element for each recording available in the room and appends it to the <code>recording-list</code> container. Each <code>div</code> element contains the recording name, as well as buttons to play and delete the recording.</p> <p>Recording deletion</p> <p>When a recording is deleted, it is removed from the recording list, but only for the user who initiated the deletion.

This is done in the <code>joinRoom</code> function of the <code>app.js</code> file:</p> <p>Limitations of the <code>RoomEvent.RecordingStatusChanged</code> event</p> <p>By using the <code>RoomEvent.RecordingStatusChanged</code> event, we can only detect when the recording has started or stopped, but not other states like <code>starting</code>, <code>stopping</code> or <code>failed</code>. Additionally, when the recording stops, the event is not triggered until the recorder participant leaves the room, causing a delay of 20 seconds approximately between the stop and when participants are notified.</p> <p>To overcome these limitations, you can follow the steps described in the advanced recording tutorial, where we implement a custom notification system. This system informs participants about the recording status by listening to webhook events and updating room metadata.</p> app.js<pre><code>async function joinRoom() {\n  // Disable 'Join' button\n  document.getElementById(\"join-button\").disabled = true;\n  document.getElementById(\"join-button\").innerText = \"Joining...\";\n\n  // Initialize a new Room object\n  room = new LivekitClient.Room();\n\n  // Specify the actions when events take place in the room\n  // On every new Track received...\n  room.on(\n    LivekitClient.RoomEvent.TrackSubscribed,\n    (track, _publication, participant) =&gt; {\n      addTrack(track, participant.identity);\n    }\n  );\n\n  // On every new Track destroyed...\n  room.on(\n    LivekitClient.RoomEvent.TrackUnsubscribed,\n    (track, _publication, participant) =&gt; {\n      track.detach();\n      document.getElementById(track.sid)?.remove();\n\n      if (track.kind === \"video\") {\n        removeVideoContainer(participant.identity);\n      }\n    }\n  );\n\n  // When recording status changes...\n  room.on(\n    LivekitClient.RoomEvent.RecordingStatusChanged,\n    async (isRecording) =&gt; {\n      await updateRecordingInfo(isRecording);\n    }\n  );\n\n  try {\n    // Get the room name and participant name from the form\n    const roomName = document.getElementById(\"room-name\").value;\n    const userName = document.getElementById(\"participant-name\").value;\n\n    // Get a token from your application server with the room name and participant name\n    const token = await getToken(roomName, userName);\n\n    // Connect to the room with the LiveKit URL and the token\n    await room.connect(LIVEKIT_URL, token);\n\n    // Hide the 'Join room' page and show the 'Room' page\n    document.getElementById(\"room-title\").innerText = roomName;\n    document.getElementById(\"join\").hidden = true;\n    document.getElementById(\"room\").hidden = false;\n\n    // Publish your camera and microphone\n    await room.localParticipant.enableCameraAndMicrophone();\n    const localVideoTrack = this.room.localParticipant.videoTrackPublications\n      .values()\n      .next().value.track;\n    addTrack(localVideoTrack, userName, true);\n\n    // Update recording info\n    await updateRecordingInfo(room.isRecording);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log(\"There was an error connecting to the room:\", error.message);\n    await leaveRoom();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>updateRecordingInfo</code> function updates the recording information of the room by changing the recording button's text and color according to the recording status. It also shows or hides the alert message that informs the user that the room is being recorded. Finally, it updates the recording list by calling the <code>listRecordings</code> function.</p> <p>This function retrieves all recordings available for the room from the backend and displays their relevant information by invoking the <code>showRecordingList</code> function:</p> app.js<pre><code>function showRecordingList(recordings) {\n  const recordingsList = document.getElementById(\"recording-list\");\n\n  if (recordings.length === 0) {\n    recordingsList.innerHTML = \"&lt;span&gt;There are no recordings available&lt;/span&gt;\";\n  } else {\n    recordingsList.innerHTML = \"\";\n  }\n\n  recordings.forEach((recording) =&gt; {\n    const recordingName = recording.name;\n\n    const recordingContainer = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    recordingContainer.className = \"recording-container\";\n    recordingContainer.id = recordingName;\n\n    recordingContainer.innerHTML = `\n            &lt;i class=\"fa-solid fa-file-video\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"recording-info\"&gt;\n                &lt;p class=\"recording-name\"&gt;${recordingName}&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"recording-actions\"&gt;\n                &lt;button title=\"Play\" class=\"icon-button\" onclick=\"displayRecording('${recordingName}')\"&gt;\n                    &lt;i class=\"fa-solid fa-play\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n                &lt;/button&gt;\n                &lt;button title=\"Delete\" class=\"icon-button delete-button\" onclick=\"deleteRecording('${recordingName}')\"&gt;\n                    &lt;i class=\"fa-solid fa-trash\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n                &lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        `;\n\n    recordingsList.append(recordingContainer);\n  });\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>showRecordingList</code> function creates a new <code>div</code> element for each recording available in the room and appends it to the <code>recording-list</code> container. Each <code>div</code> element contains the recording name, as well as buttons to play and delete the recording.</p> <p>Recording deletion</p> <p>When a recording is deleted, it is removed from the recording list, but only for the user who initiated the deletion. Other users will continue to see the recording in their list until it is refreshed.</p> <p>In the advanced recording tutorial, we show how to implement a custom notification system that alerts all participants of a recording's deletion by sending data messages.</p> <p>When the user clicks the play button, the <code>displayRecording</code> function is called to play the recording. This function opens a dialog window with an embedded video element and sets the source of the video to the get recording endpoint of the server application:</p> app.js<pre><code>function displayRecording(recordingName) {\n  const recordingVideoDialog = document.getElementById(\n    \"recording-video-dialog\"\n  );\n  recordingVideoDialog.showModal();\n  const recordingVideo = document.getElementById(\"recording-video\");\n  recordingVideo.src = `/recordings/${recordingName}`;\n}\n</code></pre> index.html<pre><code>&lt;dialog id=\"recording-video-dialog\"&gt;\n    &lt;video id=\"recording-video\" autoplay controls&gt;&lt;/video&gt;\n    &lt;button class=\"btn btn-secondary\" id=\"close-recording-video-dialog\" onclick=\"closeRecording()\"&gt;\n        Close\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/dialog&gt;\n</code></pre>","tags":["Platform"]},{"location":"docs/tutorials/advanced-features/recording-basic-s3/#general-recording-page","title":"General recording page","text":"<p>The <code>recordings.html</code> file defines the HTML for the general recording page.

We will concentrate on the following files in the <code>src</code> directory:</p> <ul> <li><code>main.ts</code>: This file defines the root application component. It imports the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code>, where we configure the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</li> <li><code>app/app.component.ts</code>: This file defines the AppComponent, the primary and sole component of the application. It is responsible for requesting the OpenVidu token and passing it to the videoconference component, facilitating the connection to the OpenVidu Room.</li> <li><code>styles.scss</code>: This file defines the global styles of the application. Here, you can customize the UI of the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</li> </ul> <p>To use OpenVidu Components Angular in your application, you need to install the library and import the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code> in your Angular module. Let's see how to do this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create an Angular Project (version 17 or higher)</p> <p>To begin, you will need to create a new Angular project if you haven't already.

Therefore, you will see many configuration files and other components that are not the primary focus of this tutorial. We will concentrate on the following files in the <code>src</code> directory:</p> <ul> <li><code>main.ts</code>: This file defines the root application component. It imports the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code>, where we configure the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</li> <li><code>app/app.component.ts</code>: This file defines the AppComponent, the primary and sole component of the application. It is responsible for requesting the OpenVidu token and passing it to the videoconference component, facilitating the connection to the OpenVidu Room.</li> <li><code>styles.scss</code>: This file defines the global styles of the application. Here, you can customize the UI of the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</li> </ul> <p>To use OpenVidu Components Angular in your application, you need to install the library and import the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code> in your Angular module. Let's see how to do this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create an Angular Project (version 17 or higher)</p> <p>To begin, you will need to create a new Angular project if you haven't already. Ensure you have Node.js and the Angular CLI installed. Then, run the following command to create a new Angular project:</p> <pre><code>ng new your-project-name\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>your-project-name</code> with the desired name for your project.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add Angular Material to your project</p> <p>OpenVidu Components Angular needs Angular Material, which provides a range of UI components. To add Angular Material to your project, navigate to your project directory and run:</p> <pre><code>ng add @angular/material\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Install OpenVidu Components Angular</p> <p>With your Angular project set up, it's time to add videoconferencing capabilities with OpenVidu Components Angular. Install the library using npm:</p> <pre><code>npm install openvidu-components-angular\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Import and use OpenVidu Components Angular</p> <p>To use OpenVidu Components Angular in your application, you need to:</p> <ol> <li>Import the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code> in your Angular application.</li> <li>Configure the module with the <code>OpenViduComponentsConfig</code> object.</li> <li>Add the component to your template file.</li> <li>Assign the OpenVidu token and LiveKit URL to the component.</li> <li>Customize the appearance of the components using CSS variables.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> main.tsapp.component.tsstyles.scss <p>In your <code>main.ts</code> application file, import the it and configure it as follows:</p> <pre><code>// Other imports ...\n\nimport { OpenViduComponentsModule, OpenViduComponentsConfig } from 'openvidu-components-angular';\n\nconst config: OpenViduComponentsConfig = {\n    production: true,\n};\n\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\n    providers: [\n        importProvidersFrom(\n            OpenViduComponentsModule.forRoot(config)\n            // Other imports ...\n        ),\n        provideAnimations(),\n    ],\n}).catch((err) =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre> <p>Use the <code>ov-videoconference</code> component to create a videoconference.

Therefore, you will see many configuration files and other components that are not the primary focus of this tutorial. We will concentrate on the following files in the <code>src</code> directory:</p> <ul> <li><code>main.ts</code>: This file defines the root application component. It imports the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code>, where we configure the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</li> <li><code>app/app.component.ts</code>: This file defines the AppComponent, the primary and sole component of the application. It is responsible for requesting the OpenVidu token and passing it to the videoconference component, facilitating the connection to the OpenVidu Room.</li> <li><code>styles.scss</code>: This file defines the global styles of the application. Here, you can customize the UI of the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</li> </ul> <p>To use OpenVidu Components Angular in your application, you need to install the library and import the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code> in your Angular module. Let's see how to do this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create an Angular Project (version 17 or higher)</p> <p>To begin, you will need to create a new Angular project if you haven't already. Ensure you have Node.js and the Angular CLI installed. Then, run the following command to create a new Angular project:</p> <pre><code>ng new your-project-name\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>your-project-name</code> with the desired name for your project.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add Angular Material to your project</p> <p>OpenVidu Components Angular needs Angular Material, which provides a range of UI components. To add Angular Material to your project, navigate to your project directory and run:</p> <pre><code>ng add @angular/material\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Install OpenVidu Components Angular</p> <p>With your Angular project set up, it's time to add videoconferencing capabilities with OpenVidu Components Angular. Install the library using npm:</p> <pre><code>npm install openvidu-components-angular\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Import and use OpenVidu Components Angular</p> <p>To use OpenVidu Components Angular in your application, you need to:</p> <ol> <li>Import the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code> in your Angular application.</li> <li>Configure the module with the <code>OpenViduComponentsConfig</code> object.</li> <li>Add the component to your template file.</li> <li>Assign the OpenVidu token and LiveKit URL to the component.</li> <li>Customize the appearance of the components using CSS variables.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> main.tsapp.component.tsstyles.scss <p>In your <code>main.ts</code> application file, import the it and configure it as follows:</p> <pre><code>// Other imports ...\n\nimport { OpenViduComponentsModule, OpenViduComponentsConfig } from 'openvidu-components-angular';\n\nconst config: OpenViduComponentsConfig = {\n    production: true,\n};\n\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\n    providers: [\n        importProvidersFrom(\n            OpenViduComponentsModule.forRoot(config)\n            // Other imports ...\n        ),\n        provideAnimations(),\n    ],\n}).catch((err) =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre> <p>Use the <code>ov-videoconference</code> component to create a videoconference.

Therefore, you will see many configuration files and other components that are not the primary focus of this tutorial. We will concentrate on the following files in the <code>src</code> directory:</p> <ul> <li><code>main.ts</code>: This file defines the root application component. It imports the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code>, where we configure the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</li> <li><code>app/app.component.ts</code>: This file defines the AppComponent, the primary and sole component of the application. It is responsible for requesting the OpenVidu token and passing it to the videoconference component, facilitating the connection to the OpenVidu Room.</li> <li><code>styles.scss</code>: This file defines the global styles of the application. Here, you can customize the UI of the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</li> </ul> <p>To use OpenVidu Components Angular in your application, you need to install the library and import the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code> in your Angular module. Let's see how to do this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create an Angular Project (version 17 or higher)</p> <p>To begin, you will need to create a new Angular project if you haven't already. Ensure you have Node.js and the Angular CLI installed. Then, run the following command to create a new Angular project:</p> <pre><code>ng new your-project-name\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>your-project-name</code> with the desired name for your project.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add Angular Material to your project</p> <p>OpenVidu Components Angular needs Angular Material, which provides a range of UI components. To add Angular Material to your project, navigate to your project directory and run:</p> <pre><code>ng add @angular/material\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Install OpenVidu Components Angular</p> <p>With your Angular project set up, it's time to add videoconferencing capabilities with OpenVidu Components Angular. Install the library using npm:</p> <pre><code>npm install openvidu-components-angular\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Import and use OpenVidu Components Angular</p> <p>To use OpenVidu Components Angular in your application, you need to:</p> <ol> <li>Import the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code> in your Angular application.</li> <li>Configure the module with the <code>OpenViduComponentsConfig</code> object.</li> <li>Add the component to your template file.</li> <li>Assign the OpenVidu token and LiveKit URL to the component.</li> <li>Customize the appearance of the components using CSS variables.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> main.tsapp.component.tsstyles.scss <p>In your <code>main.ts</code> application file, import the it and configure it as follows:</p> <pre><code>// Other imports ...\n\nimport { OpenViduComponentsModule, OpenViduComponentsConfig } from 'openvidu-components-angular';\n\nconst config: OpenViduComponentsConfig = {\n    production: true,\n};\n\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\n    providers: [\n        importProvidersFrom(\n            OpenViduComponentsModule.forRoot(config)\n            // Other imports ...\n        ),\n        provideAnimations(),\n    ],\n}).catch((err) =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre> <p>Use the <code>ov-videoconference</code> component to create a videoconference.

Therefore, you will see many configuration files and other components that are not the primary focus of this tutorial. We will concentrate on the following files in the <code>src</code> directory:</p> <ul> <li><code>main.ts</code>: This file defines the root application component. It imports the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code>, where we configure the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</li> <li><code>app/app.component.ts</code>: This file defines the AppComponent, the primary and sole component of the application. It is responsible for requesting the OpenVidu token and passing it to the videoconference component, facilitating the connection to the OpenVidu Room.</li> <li> <p><code>styles.scss</code>: This file defines the global styles of the application. Here, you can customize the UI of the OpenVidu Components Angular library.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>app/models/participant-app.model.ts</code>: Contains the <code>ParticipantAppModel</code> class that extends the <code>ParticipantModel</code> class to add the ability to raise and lower the hand.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To use OpenVidu Components Angular in your application, you need to install the library and import the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code> in your Angular module. Let's see how to do this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create an Angular Project (version 17 or higher)</p> <p>To begin, you will need to create a new Angular project if you haven't already. Ensure you have Node.js and the Angular CLI installed. Then, run the following command to create a new Angular project:</p> <pre><code>ng new your-project-name\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>your-project-name</code> with the desired name for your project.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add Angular Material to your project</p> <p>OpenVidu Components Angular needs Angular Material, which provides a range of UI components. To add Angular Material to your project, navigate to your project directory and run:</p> <pre><code>ng add @angular/material\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Install OpenVidu Components Angular</p> <p>With your Angular project set up, it's time to add videoconferencing capabilities with OpenVidu Components Angular. Install the library using npm:</p> <pre><code>npm install openvidu-components-angular\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Import and use OpenVidu Components Angular</p> <p>To use OpenVidu Components Angular in your application, you need to:</p> <ol> <li>Import the <code>OpenViduComponentsModule</code> in your Angular application.</li> <li>Configure the module with the <code>OpenViduComponentsConfig</code> object.</li> <li>Add the component to your template file.</li> <li>Assign the OpenVidu token and LiveKit URL to the component.</li> <li>Customize the appearance of the components using CSS variables.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> main.tsapp.component.tsmodels/participant-app.model.tsstyles.scss <p>In your <code>main.ts</code> application file, import the it and configure it as follows:</p> <pre><code>// Other imports ...\n\nimport { OpenViduComponentsModule, OpenViduComponentsConfig } from 'openvidu-components-angular';\n\nconst config: OpenViduComponentsConfig = {\n    production: true,\n};\n\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\n    providers: [\n        importProvidersFrom(\n            OpenViduComponentsModule.forRoot(config)\n            // Other imports ...\n        ),\n        provideAnimations(),\n    ],\n}).catch((err) =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre> <p>Use the <code>ov-videoconference</code> component to create a videoconference.

The <code>AppComponent</code> class is responsible for requesting the token and passing it to the <code>ov-videoconference</code> component.</p> <pre><code>import {\n  ParticipantModel,\n  ParticipantService,\n  OpenViduComponentsModule\n} from 'openvidu-components-angular';\n\nenum DataTopicApp {\n  HAND_TOGGLE = 'handToggle'\n}\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  template:`\n    &lt;!-- OpenVidu Video Conference Component --&gt;\n    &lt;ov-videoconference\n      [prejoin]=\"true\"\n      [token]=\"token\"\n      [livekitUrl]=\"LIVEKIT_URL\"\n      (onTokenRequested)=\"onTokenRequested($event)\"\n      (onRoomCreated)=\"handleRemoteHand($event)\"\n    &gt;\n      &lt;div *ovToolbarAdditionalButtons&gt;\n        &lt;button toolbar-btn mat-icon-button (click)=\"handleLocalHand()\" [class.active-btn]=\"hasHandRaised\"&gt;\n          &lt;mat-icon matTooltip=\"Toggle hand\"&gt;front_hand&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\n        &lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n\n      &lt;div *ovStream=\"let track\" style=\"height: 100%\"&gt;\n        &lt;ov-stream [track]=\"track\"&gt;&lt;/ov-stream&gt;\n        @if (track.participant.hasHandRaised) {\n        &lt;mat-icon @inOutHandAnimation id=\"hand-notification\"&gt;front_hand&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\n        }\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n\n      &lt;div *ovParticipantPanelItemElements=\"let participant\"&gt;\n        @if (participant.hasHandRaised) {\n        &lt;mat-icon&gt;front_hand&lt;/mat-icon&gt;\n        }\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/ov-videoconference&gt;\n  `,\n  styles: [''],\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [OpenViduComponentsModule, MatIconButton, MatIcon]\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  // For local development, leave these variables empty\n  // For production, configure them with correct URLs depending on your deployment\n\n  APPLICATION_SERVER_URL = '';

To overcome these challenges, the following steps need to be taken:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Localhost limitations:</p> <p>The usage of <code>localhost</code> in our Ionic app is restricted, preventing seamless communication between the application client and the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Serve over local network:</p> <p>The application must be served over our local network to enable communication between the device and the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure connection requirement for WebRTC API:</p> <p>The WebRTC API demands a secure connection for functionality outside of localhost, necessitating the serving of the application over HTTPS.</p> </li> </ol> <p>If you run OpenVidu locally you don't need to worry about this. OpenVidu will handle all of the above requirements for you. For more information, see section Accessing your local deployment from other devices on your network.</p> <p>Now, let's explore how to run the application on a mobile device:</p> <p>Requirements</p> <p>Before running the application on a mobile device, make sure that the device is connected to the same network as your PC and the mobile is connected to the PC via USB or Wi-Fi.</p>  Android device iOS device <pre><code>npm run android\n</code></pre> <p>You will need Ruby  and Cocoapods  installed in your computer.</p> <p>The app must be signed with a development team.

To overcome these challenges, the following steps need to be taken:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Localhost limitations:</p> <p>The usage of <code>localhost</code> in our Ionic app is restricted, preventing seamless communication between the application client and the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Serve over local network:</p> <p>The application must be served over our local network to enable communication between the device and the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure connection requirement for WebRTC API:</p> <p>The WebRTC API demands a secure connection for functionality outside of localhost, necessitating the serving of the application over HTTPS.</p> </li> </ol> <p>If you run OpenVidu locally you don't need to worry about this. OpenVidu will handle all of the above requirements for you. For more information, see section Accessing your local deployment from other devices on your network.</p> <p>Now, let's explore how to run the application on a mobile device:</p> <p>Requirements</p> <p>Before running the application on a mobile device, make sure that the device is connected to the same network as your PC and the mobile is connected to the PC via USB or Wi-Fi.</p>  Android device iOS device <pre><code>npm run android\n</code></pre> <p>You will need Ruby  and Cocoapods  installed in your computer.</p> <p>The app must be signed with a development team.

To overcome these challenges, the following steps need to be taken:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Localhost limitations:</p> <p>The usage of <code>localhost</code> in our Ionic app is restricted, preventing seamless communication between the application client and the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Serve over local network:</p> <p>The application must be served over our local network to enable communication between the device and the server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secure connection requirement for WebRTC API:</p> <p>The WebRTC API demands a secure connection for functionality outside of localhost, necessitating the serving of the application over HTTPS.</p> </li> </ol> <p>If you run OpenVidu locally you don't need to worry about this. OpenVidu will handle all of the above requirements for you. For more information, see section Accessing your local deployment from other devices on your network.</p> <p>Now, let's explore how to run the application on a mobile device:</p> <p>Requirements</p> <p>Before running the application on a mobile device, make sure that the device is connected to the same network as your PC and the mobile is connected to the PC via USB or Wi-Fi.</p>  Android device iOS device <pre><code>npm run android\n</code></pre> <p>You will need Ruby  and Cocoapods  installed in your computer.</p> <p>The app must be signed with a development team. To do so, open the project in Xcode and select a development team in the Signing &amp; Capabilities editor.</p> <pre><code>npm run ios\n</code></pre> <p>The script will ask you for the device you want to run the application on. You should select the real device you have connected to your computer.</p> <p>Once the mobile device has been selected, the script will launch the application on the device and you will see a screen like this:</p> <p></p><p></p><p></p> <p>This screen allows you to configure the URLs of the application server and the LiveKit server. You need to set them up for requesting tokens to your application server and connecting to the LiveKit server.</p> <p>Once you have configured the URLs, you can join a video call room by providing a room name and a user name. After joining the room, you will be able to see your own video and audio tracks, as well as the video and audio tracks of the other participants in the room.</p> <p></p><p></p><p></p> <p></p><p></p><p></p> </li> </ol> <p>For more information, check the Ionic tutorial.</p> <p>To run the client application tutorial, you need Android Studio  installed on your development computer.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open Android Studio and import the project located at <code>openvidu-livekit-tutorials/application-client/openvidu-android</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Run the application in an emulator or a physical device by clicking the \"Run\" button in Android Studio.

Its design principles are:</p> <ul> <li>Simplicity: OpenVidu Meet is built on the same concepts as OpenVidu, but wraps them in a higher-level API, ideal for virtual meeting use cases. Simply manage rooms, meetings, and recordings.</li> <li>Feature-rich: OpenVidu Meet includes all the features you would expect from a modern video conferencing solution: HQ audio/video, screen sharing, chat, recording, and more. We will be continuously adding more features, taking advantage of all the advanced capabilities of OpenVidu: live-captions, AI integrations, streaming to large audiences, breakout rooms...</li> <li>Refined UI/UX: OpenVidu Meet user interface boasts a modern and intuitive design. Years of experience in the video conferencing space have been distilled into a polished user experience that feels familiar and gets out of the way. Perfect for all kinds of use cases, from e-learning to telehealth, collaboration and customer support.</li> <li>Self-hosted and secure by design: OpenVidu Meet is self-hosted, allowing you to retain full control over your data and compliance, and at the same time leverage your infrastructure. It can be easily deployed on-premises or in the cloud, with native integrations available for AWS, Azure, and GCP.</li> <li>Embed-first integration: OpenVidu Meet can act as a final application, but it is also designed to be embedded into your own web app with minimal effort.

Both products serve complementary needs:</p> <ul> <li>OpenVidu Platform is just what OpenVidu has always been: a powerful platform for builders who want complete flexibility with SDKs and APIs to craft bespoke real-time experiences. For users of any previous version of OpenVidu, nothing changes: what was previously \"OpenVidu\" has now simply been renamed \"OpenVidu Platform\".</li> <li>OpenVidu Meet is a response to the growing demand for specialized video conferencing solutions that cater to the unique needs of virtual meetings. While OpenVidu Platform provides a powerful foundation for real-time communication, OpenVidu Meet builds on that foundation to deliver a more focused set of features and a simplified integration process.</li> </ul> <p>By separating the product lines, we keep the developer\u2011first power of OpenVidu Platform while offering a refined, ready\u2011to\u2011use solution for common videoconferencing use cases (e\u2011learning, telehealth, collaboration, customer support...). This clarity helps teams choose low\u2011level control with OpenVidu Platform, or the fastest path to value-off\u2011the\u2011shelf with OpenVidu Meet.

It brings to your own managed service advanced capabilities usually reserved only for SaaS solutions. There are two main reasons why you may need to self-host the real-time solution yourself:</p> <ul> <li>Privacy: you can't afford to let your client's data get out of your reach. OpenVidu allows you to meet all your privacy and regulatory requirements: no data at all is sent to any third-party server. Everything is self-contained on your own servers.</li> <li>Leverage your resources: your organization has access to its own infrastructure that can be used to host these services. SaaS solutions generally offer complete freedom from infrastructure management, but this comes with generally high prices that cover both the provider's infrastructure and their service surcharge. OpenVidu allows taking full advantage of your own infrastructure, reducing costs and increasing performance.</li> </ul> <p>It is important to mention that when we talk about self-hosting OpenVidu, we don't just mean installing it in bare-metal servers or private VPCs. OpenVidu also supports deployments in the most popular cloud providers, using their native services when possible. AWS and Azure are currently supported, and others are coming soon. You can learn more about the different options to deploy OpenVidu in the deployment types section.</p> <p>One of OpenVidu's main goals is offering a self-hosted, production-ready live-video platform with all the advanced capabilities typically reserved for SaaS solutions. This includes outstanding performance, scalability, fault tolerance and observability:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Performance</p> <p>OpenVidu is built to be incredibly powerful. It is based on the best open source WebRTC stacks: LiveKit  and mediasoup . By combining the best of both worlds, OpenVidu provides outstanding performance.</p> <p> Learn more about performance</p> </li> <li> <p> Scalability</p> <p>OpenVidu has been designed from the outset with scalability in mind. Host videoconference rooms and large live streams with hundreds of participants. Autoscale your cluster to adapt to the demand and optimize your resources.</p> <p> Learn more about scalability</p> </li> <li> <p> Fault Tolerance</p> <p>OpenVidu offers fault tolerance in all its components. Deploy a reliable high-availability cluster knowing that if one of your node goes down, others will be able to continue working with no downtime.</p> <p> Learn more about fault tolerance</p> </li> <li> <p> Observability</p> <p>OpenVidu brings everything necessary to monitor the status, health, load and history of your deployment.
