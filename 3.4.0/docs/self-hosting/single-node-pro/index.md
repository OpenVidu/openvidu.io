# OpenVidu Single Node PRO installation

OpenVidu Single Node PRO brings all the features of OpenVidu Single Node COMMUNITY plus [**2x performance**](../production-ready/performance/) and [**advanced observability**](../production-ready/observability/). It is aimed to users that want a single-node setup but still want OpenVidu PRO features.
