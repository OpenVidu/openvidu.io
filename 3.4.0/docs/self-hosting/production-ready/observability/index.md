# Observability

Any production software needs to be observable. But in real-time applications this becomes an absolute priority. You must be able to:

- Detect and solve networking issues that may prevent your users from connecting to your Rooms.
- Monitor the quality of the video and audio streams, that will reflect in your users' experience.
- Analyze the load in your hardware to detect bottlenecks and scale your deployment accordingly.
- Store historical data to analyze past issues and trends to make future decisions based on them.

OpenVidu brings everything you need to fulfill these requirements. We collect **events**, **metrics** and **logs** from your deployment and provide [**OpenVidu Dashboard**](openvidu-dashboard/) and a [**Grafana stack**](grafana-stack/) to navigate them.
