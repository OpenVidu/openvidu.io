OpenVidu Meet is a fully fledged video call solution built on top of OpenVidu. You can use it out of the box, or you can embed it in your own application. Either way, OpenVidu Meet provides a rich set of features and a great degree of customization, so you can tailor it to your needs and match your branding.

## Embed OpenVidu Meet into your app

You can integrate a complete video call solution into your application with just a few lines of code using **OpenVidu Meet Embedded**. You can also customize its look and feel to match your application's design, branding colors and styles.

## Should I use OpenVidu Platform instead?

If your use case requires other features or a more specific integration, you may want to consider using **OpenVidu Platform**. It supports low-level SDKs to build any type of real-time experience. You can find a comparison between both OpenVidu solutions here: [OpenVidu Meet vs OpenVidu Platform](../../openvidu-meet-vs-openvidu-platform/).
