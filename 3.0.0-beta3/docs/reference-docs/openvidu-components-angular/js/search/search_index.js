       The *ovLayout directive empowers you to replace the default room layout with a customized one.\nTo ensure that the default StreamComponent functions correctly with participant tracks, you can access all local tracks using the tracks accessor.\nExtracting streams from remote participants can be more complex, but openvidu-angular simplifies the process with the RemoteParticipantTracksPipe, which facilitates the extraction of each participant's stream.\nIn the example below, take note of the HTML template's structure. The *ngFor statements employ the | tracks pipe to handle tracks effectively.\n\nExample :import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { Component, OnDestroy, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { lastValueFrom, Subscription } from 'rxjs';\nimport {\n    ParticipantModel,\n    ParticipantService,\n    OpenViduComponentsModule,\n} from 'openvidu-components-angular';\nimport { NgClass } from '@angular/common';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'app-root',\n    template: `\n        \n        \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                    @for (track of localParticipant.tracks; track track) {\n                    \n                        \n                    \n                    }\n\n                    \n                    @for (track of remoteParticipants | tracks; track track) {\n                    \n                        \n                    \n                    }\n                \n            \n        \n    `,\n    styles: `\n        .container {\n            display: flex;\n            flex-wrap: wrap;\n            justify-content: space-between;\n        }\n        .item {\n            flex: 0 50%;\n            height: 250px;\n            margin-bottom: 2%;\n        }\n        .hidden {\n            display: none;\n        }\n    `,\n    standalone: true,\n    imports: [OpenViduComponentsModule, NgClass],\n})\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n    // For local development, leave these variables empty\n    // For production, configure them with correct URLs depending on your deployment\n    APPLICATION_SERVER_URL = '';\n    LIVEKIT_URL = '';\n\n    // Define the name of the room and initialize the token variable\n    roomName = 'custom-layout';\n    token!: string;\n\n    // Participant-related properties\n    localParticipant!: ParticipantModel;\n    remoteParticipants!: ParticipantModel[];\n    localParticipantSubs!: Subscription;\n    remoteParticipantsSubs!: Subscription;\n\n    constructor(\n        private httpClient: HttpClient,\n        private participantService: ParticipantService\n    ) {\n        this.configureUrls();\n    }\n\n    private configureUrls() {\n        // If APPLICATION_SERVER_URL is not configured, use default value from local development\n        if (!this.APPLICATION_SERVER_URL) {\n            if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost') {\n                this.APPLICATION_SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:6080/';\n            } else {\n                this.APPLICATION_SERVER_URL =\n                    'https://' + window.location.hostname + ':6443/';\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If LIVEKIT_URL is not configured, use default value from local development\n        if (!this.LIVEKIT_URL) {\n            if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost') {\n                this.LIVEKIT_URL = 'ws://localhost:7880/';\n            } else {\n                this.LIVEKIT_URL = 'wss://' + window.location.hostname + ':7443/';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    ngOnInit() {\n        // Subscribe to participants' updates\n        this.subscribeToParticipants();\n    }\n\n    // Function to request a token when a participant joins the room\n    async onTokenRequested(participantName: string) {\n        const { token } = await this.getToken(this.roomName, participantName);\n        this.token = token;\n    }\n\n    ngOnDestroy() {\n        // Unsubscribe from participant updates to prevent memory leaks\n        this.localParticipantSubs.unsubscribe();\n        this.remoteParticipantsSubs.unsubscribe();\n    }\n\n    // Subscribe to updates for local and remote participants\n    subscribeToParticipants() {\n        this.localParticipantSubs =\n            this.participantService.localParticipant$.subscribe((p) => {\n                if (p) this.localParticipant = p;\n            });\n\n        this.remoteParticipantsSubs =\n            this.participantService.remoteParticipants$.subscribe(\n                (participants) => {\n                    this.remoteParticipants = participants;\n                }\n            );\n    }\n\n    // Function to get a token from the server\n    getToken(roomName: string, participantName: string): Promise {\n        try {\n            // Send a POST request to the server to obtain a token\n            return lastValueFrom(\n                this.httpClient.post(this.APPLICATION_SERVER_URL + 'token', {\n                    roomName,\n                    participantName,\n                })\n            );\n        } catch (error: any) {\n            // Handle errors, e.g., if the server is not reachable\n            if (error.status === 404) {\n                throw {\n                    status: error.status,\n                    message:\n                        'Cannot connect with the backend.

       The *ovPanel directive empowers you to seamlessly replace default panels with custom ones.\nIt also provides the flexibility to insert elements tagged with the ChatPanelDirective, ParticipantsPanelDirective, and AdditionalPanelsDirective.\nIn the example below, we showcase how to entirely replace the PanelComponent using the ChatPanelDirective.\nWithin it, you can tailor the appearance and behavior of the ParticipantsPanelComponent and ChatPanelComponent using their respective directives.\n\nExample :import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { Component }

       The *ovStream directive empowers you to substitute the default StreamComponent template with a custom one.\nIn the example below, we demonstrate how to customize the position and styles of a participant's nickname by replacing the default stream component.\nWith the ovStream directive, you can access the track object within its context using the let keyword and referencing the track variable as follows: *ovStream=\"let track\". This allows you to access the ParticipantModel object using track.participant.\nIn the example provided below, we illustrate how to achieve this customization with just a few lines of code.\n\nExample :import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { lastValueFrom } from 'rxjs';\n\nimport {\n    OpenViduComponentsModule,\n    ApiDirectiveModule,\n    OpenViduComponentsDirectiveModule,\n} from 'openvidu-components-angular';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'app-root',\n    template: `\n        \n        \n            \n            \n                \n                \n\n                \n                {{ track.participant.name }}\n            \n        \n    `,\n    styles: `\n        p {\n            position: absolute;\n            bottom: 0;\n            border: 2px solid;\n            background: #000000;\n        }\n    `,\n    standalone: true,\n    imports: [OpenViduComponentsModule],\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n    // For local development, leave these variables empty\n    // For production, configure them with correct URLs depending on your deployment\n    APPLICATION_SERVER_URL = '';\n    LIVEKIT_URL = '';\n\n    // Define the name of the room and initialize the token variable\n    roomName = 'custom-stream';\n    token!: string;\n\n    constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {\n        this.configureUrls();\n    }\n\n    private configureUrls() {\n        // If APPLICATION_SERVER_URL is not configured, use default value from local development\n        if (!this.APPLICATION_SERVER_URL) {\n            if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost') {\n                this.APPLICATION_SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:6080/';\n            } else {\n                this.APPLICATION_SERVER_URL =\n                    'https://' + window.location.hostname + ':6443/';\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If LIVEKIT_URL is not configured, use default value from local development\n        if (!this.LIVEKIT_URL) {\n            if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost') {\n                this.LIVEKIT_URL = 'ws://localhost:7880/';\n            } else {\n                this.LIVEKIT_URL = 'wss://' + window.location.hostname + ':7443/';\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Function to request a token when a participant joins the room\n    async onTokenRequested(participantName: string) {\n        const { token } = await this.getToken(this.roomName, participantName);\n        this.token = token;\n    }\n\n    // Function to get a token from the server\n    getToken(roomName: string, participantName: string): Promise {\n        try {\n            // Send a POST request to the server to obtain a token\n            return lastValueFrom(\n                this.httpClient.post(this.APPLICATION_SERVER_URL + 'token', {\n                    roomName,\n                    participantName,\n                })\n            );\n        } catch (error: any) {\n            // Handle errors, e.g., if the server is not reachable\n            if (error.status === 404) {\n                throw {\n                    status: error.status,\n                    message:\n                        'Cannot connect with the backend.
