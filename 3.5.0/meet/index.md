## Free open-source edition vs Commercial edition

OpenVidu Meet is available in two editions:

Everything listed in the [Features](#features) section is available in OpenVidu Meet COMMUNITY: HD video, HiFi audio, recording, screen sharing, chat, virtual backgrounds, and more.

OpenVidu Meet COMMUNITY is perfect for production deployments with moderate user load. It can be easily deployed on your own servers, and you can customize its branding to match your organization’s identity. If necessary, upgrading to OpenVidu PRO is seamless and non-disruptive.

OpenVidu PRO follows a simple pricing model based on the size of your deployment (number of CPU cores). Check the [OpenVidu pricing page](https://openvidu.io/pricing) for more details.
